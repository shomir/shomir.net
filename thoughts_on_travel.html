<h1><center>I. Disorientation</center></h1>

  <p><strong>Spring 2017
  <br/>Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport</strong></p>
  
  <p>I stepped off the plane uncertain where I had been. It was a morning flight, which meant I had woken up early, and my thoughts were still leaden with fatigue. All my luggage was with me--nothing checked--and I wasn't wearing a coat, which meant I hadn't been somewhere cold. I lived in Cincinnati, and my car was waiting for me in the economy lot, which meant the trip hadn't been long. I considered those clues.</p>
  
  <p>As I entered the terminal, I looked backward at the electronic board on the wall next to the gate. It didn't say where my plane had arrived from. Even if it did, I could have had a layover somewhere. A gate agent stood nearby, but I didn't consider asking her. Facing the concourse, I couldn't remember which way the exit was, but that was normal for me in this airport. Other arriving passengers turned left and I followed them.</p>
  
  <p>Where had I been, and why? Looking at my phone would produce the answer in seconds, but I felt like I should try to remember. It was a strange mental space to occupy, but it was also calming. If the trip had created new tasks for me, I didn't know them. My only obligation in the moment was to keep walking, so I did that, feeling vaguely self-conscious. No one around me knew I was grappling with a fundamental, almost existential question. Play it cool, I thought. All of us just got here.</p>
  
  <hr/>

  <p><strong>May 31, 2016
  <br/>Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</strong></p>

  <p>I was disassociating, though I didn't realize it. I got off the bus at Forbes and Morewood and walked onto Carnegie Mellon University's campus, the final stage of my daily commute to work as a postdoc. I was present enough to obey the walk signal, but I was also imagining my path from above. I thought about the firmness of the ground beneath the pavement, but also its fungibility. I was returning to work the day after a transatlantic flight, part of a months-long streak of frequent long-distance travel. I thought about the roundness of the Earth and how quickly I had been moving from one side of it to another. I questioned what it meant to be anywhere in particular.</p>

<p>In the previous six months I had been on 34 commercial flights, for job interviews, conferences, and a vacation. I possessed a written offer for a faculty position in Cincinnati, and a verbal offer from a university on the west coast. However, there was still one interview left, for a position in the United Kingdom. In two weeks I would fly back across the Atlantic for the campus visit; directly from that I would fly to a conference in Denver; directly from that I would fly to Cincinnati for a second visit; and only after that I would return to Pittsburgh. Within a few months I would live in one of three regions: the west coast, the midwest, or in the UK.</p>

<p>Ever since I was a teenager I had aspired to this kind of travel cadence. More recently, after three years of applying for faculty positions but receiving no campus interviews or offers, the uncertainty felt worth wanting. The future was opaque, but the present felt cinematic. In the meantime, I needed to go to the next meeting, write the next paper, make the next slide deck, and board the next flight. I tried to concentrate on the tasks in front of me.</p>

  <hr/>

  <p><strong>June, 2009
  <br/>Marsfield (a suburb of Sydney), Australia</strong></p>

  <p>I looked at the orange glow on the wall a few inches from my face, and I didn't know where or when I was. I was lying on my side in a bed in the dark. The air was cold, but I had thick, warm covers. I saw my shadow and knew the orange light came from something behind me, possibly a heat source. There was no sound or motion.</p>

<p>The bed was mine, and I felt comfortable under the covers with cold air to breathe and a heat source at my back. Still, I couldn't remember how old I was, and I considered several possibilities without realizing what they meant for each other or as a whole. My frame of mind was agnostic to time, and knowing the future was unremarkable.</p>

<p>I considered whether I was in my dorm room in Hillcrest Hall, at Virginia Tech, as a college student. Sleep was a refuge from the daily tension between what I wanted to accomplish and what I seemed capable of. The walls there were painted-over cinder blocks, though. I was facing drywall.</p>

<p>I considered whether I was in my childhood bedroom, in Virginia, having just graduated from high school. The future was a blank slate. Drywall was appropriate, but the air was too cold and the building was too quiet.</p>

<p>I considered whether I was in my apartment in graduate school, in Maryland. In the intellectual sense I felt stranded in the desert. Again, the wall wasn't right. There, the paint on the walls had many tiny bubbles. The orange glow remained a mystery too, as it was for all these times and locations.</p>

<p>I cycled through these possibilities in idle curiosity while I fell back asleep.</p>

  <hr/>

  <p><strong>Summer, 2024
  <br/>Kolkata, India</strong></p>

  <p>I woke up suddenly, startled, and sat upright in the bed. It was late afternoon on a Kolkata summer day. The windows were open and the air was warm and dusty, bringing in the smells of the city. This house, where my mother had grown up, did not have air conditioning. It was made of concrete and taller than the slum houses and shacks around it. The neighborhood was dense with activity unseen but distantly audible: a cart rattling down the ally, children playing, and car horns in the distance.</p>

<p>We had arrived in India earlier in the day, after nearly 24 hours aboard planes or in airports to come from the US. It was my second ever overseas trip---the first also had been to India, six years prior---and I didn't yet have a strategy for handling with jet lag.</p>

<p>My mother turned from the dresser where she putting away clothes. She saw the blank expression on my face and she asked if I was OK. My mind was blank, and it didn't occur to me to reply. After a pause, she added instructively: "We're in India."</p>

<p>"I know." It was a reflexive reply, a stopgap while I processed the meaning. India. Of course.</p>

  <hr/>

  <p><strong>June, 1998
  <br/>London-Heathrow International Airport, United Kingdom</strong></p>

  <p>I didn't understand why we had to stop at LHR on the way to Kolkata, because at age sixteen I didn't know about the hub-and-spoke routing model that airlines use. I was on my first international trip, and the flight that brought us there from IAD had been my first flight of any kind. My mother, my sister, and I would wait fourteen hours in departure lounges for our next segment, which would fly to Kolkata by way of Delhi. I had heard that Kolkata was one of the largest cities in the world, and I was puzzled that there wasn't a direct connection from Washington.</p>

<p>In theory London was nearby, but in practice all I saw out the window was more airport. I began writing down the airline names, and by the end of the layover I had a list of twenty. My airline illiteracy was such that I assumed Delta was from Greece. American and United were definitely ours, but I was puzzled why we needed both. British Airways' huge fleet of 747s circulated around the tarmac, planes arriving and departing on routes to faraway places. I spotted a Concorde at a hard stand, unattended and quiet, nonchalant about its significance.</p>

<p>I turned on my FM radio and found a morning show. Ace's "How Long" played, and its dreary tone matched the grey skies outside. When the hosts returned, the traffic report confused me: I guessed that the "M"s were motorways, but what were "A"s? (Trains, maybe? I knew trains were a bigger deal in the UK than in the US.) The weather report gave the outside temperature in Celsius, which I couldn't relate to. It was uncomfortably warm in the terminal, and not knowing what the air was like just outside the big windows made it seem even more like an alien place.</p>

<p>Prior to departure, the unknowns of the trip---visiting my first foreign country and spending time with relatives I had met once or never---made me nervous more than excited. Now that we were underway, I took the experience in stride. In a few hours there would be another plane and a longer flight. For now, I was in a place in between places, isolated from most tokens of location.</p>

  <hr/>

  <p><strong>December 1986
  <br/>Merritt Parkway, near Bridgeport, CT</strong></p>

<p>The bare trees, empty highway, and gray pre-dawn sky could have been many places. It was early morning, and my family had just gotten underway on a road trip. I was in the back of the car, next to my sister.</p>

<p>The road was nearly empty this early in the morning; my dad wanted to set out early to beat the traffic through the New York City area. Our destination was a small town in Ohio where my Wilson family was gathering for Christmas. The drive would take most of the day. I had been told that, but I didn't grasp what it meant.</p>

<p>My understanding of topics like travel, distance, and grandparents was nascent. I didn't feel excited or anxious. I felt tired, but not in a way that I could fall asleep. I watched the trees go by and listened to the music.</p>

<h1><center>II. Longing</center></h1>  

  <p><strong>June, 1998
<br/>Washington-Dulles International Airport, Virginia</strong></p>

<p>In the early evening my mom, my sister, and I boarded our flight to LHR, our first in a sequence to get to Kolkata. The plane was a British Airways Boeing 747-100.</p>

<p>My impressions of passenger planes in movies and books hadn't prepared me to understand what I saw. As we entered the aircraft and turned right, we passed by the stairs going to the top level; I had known to see that from cross-section diagrams of the 747 but I assumed upstairs was more of the same seating as below. We passed through the Business Class cabin, through an economy cabin, and then into a second economy cabin, where we found our seats toward the back. I noticed the seats were more tightly packed than those up front, but the differing colors of upholstery in each cabin stood out to me more. I was a lanky fifteen year old who didn't need much space and had never tried to sleep while seated upright before. (I didn't know how difficult it would be.) I couldn't see a huge difference in comfort between the cabins.</p>

<p>I was aware that some people flew on a regular basis. As we passed through the business class cabin, I saw people who had already settled in and seemed nonchalant, even bored. Among them was a man in a sport coat reading a newspaper and a boy my age with headphones on, listening to music on a portable player. I imagined the man on a work trip, and the boy shuttling back and forth across the Atlantic to visit relatives or attend a special, elite school. I wondered what it was like for travel on planes to be a routine, unremarkable part of one's life. I was aware that some kids my age had already flown to visit relatives or go on vacations.</p>

<p>I felt envy for a lifestyle I didn't have. I felt embarrassment, even, for this experience to be so novel. I assumed I was already far behind and unlikely to catch up.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Spring, 2022
<br/>Blacksburg, Virginia</strong></p>

<p>I was out of the running for a scholarship to travel abroad. I had received the phone call in the early afternoon, and I hadn't been able to concentrate on schoolwork---which I had plenty of---since then. Later I had eaten dinner, though more because of routine than hunger, and then went for a walk. Now it was night and I sat on a bench at the edge of campus, staring into the distance.</p>

<p>The location of the bench was significant: a certain friend once lived in a house nearby. She had won the same scholarship three years previously, and it launched her toward winning a fellowship to attend postgraduate school at a prestigious university in the United Kingdom. We had met during my first year of college, which was her final year before graduating. During that overlap we had become unlikely friends: a polished, highly accomplished senior spending time with a criminally awkward freshman. I imagine if I contacted her about this outcome she would try to console me with stories about how previous rejected applicants had still become successful, but I didn't want that kind of consolation. It wouldn't get me the scholarship.</p>

<p>My travel plan in the application had been to spend a summer in India, in a different part than I had visited before, to work with a local aid organization building computer labs for schools. Unlike my friends who had studied abroad, I would have been there alone. Prior to the verdict I had simultaneously feared not winning (not being able to go) and winning (having to go). I was eliminated after the first round of interviews, but it hadn't been a total surprise. Compounding my weak motivation was fatigue from taking several difficult classes, and I had interviewed poorly.</p>

<p>I also wondered about the strength of my written application. Had it been too philosophical and brooding? I didn't want to sound excited about going somewhere; I felt like that would be too juvenile. Accomplishment seemed paramount to adventure, and I didn't see a point to writing about both.</p>

<p>It was getting late. In a different universe, I thought, someone might wonder where I was and would be concerned. In this one I couldn't think of anyone who cared. The people that I wanted to count as my friends often didn't seem interested in spending time with me, either because they were busy  or their priorities were elsewhere.</p>

<p>The absurdity of waiting for sympathy that wasn't coming brought me to action. Enough, I decided. I got up and began walking back to my dorm. There was homework to complete, and there were more opportunities to apply for.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>December 9, 2008
<br/>College Park, Maryland</strong></p>

<p>That evening in my apartment I submitted an application, but I doubted the worth of my effort. It was for an NSF-funded fellowship for graduate students to spend eight weeks in Australia. A couple months prior I had received the program announcement from a university email list, but after a quick read I had archived it. I didn't win things like that. However, soon afterward I was rejected for an internship and wondered what I would do next summer. Grudgingly I moved the announcement back to my inbox and began the application. I wanted to avoid the regret of not trying.</p>

<p>Four years earlier I had tried to win a fellowship to spend a summer in India working with an NGO, and my application was eliminated in the first round of interviews. A year later I had applied for the Goldwater Scholarship, a nationally-competitive undergraduate award for STEM majors, and I didn't get it. Later I had applied for the National Science Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowship Program, and I didn't get that either. Many of my college friends in Hillcrest, Virginia Tech's honors dorm, had received multiple nationally-recognized scholarships or fellowships. Now I was three years into graduate school and motivated, perhaps, by anachronism. I still wanted to win something that felt significant---by an arbitrary measure---and I still wanted to travel overseas. I had visited India twice on family trips, in 1998 and 2004, and I had been to Poland for a conference in 2007. Somehow those didn't count: as someone with Indian ancestry it felt obligatory to go to India, and the Poland trip had been brief and underwhelming. I realized I had moved the goalposts further away, but I didn't care.</p>

<p>In some ways I had made the application for this new experience as difficult as possible. The program sent US graduate students to one of several countries in East Asia and the Pacific, and I had chosen to apply for Australia, the option that historically received the most applications and had the lowest acceptance rate. Already having a collaborator in Australia could have strengthened my application, but I knew no one; to find a host for my visit, I searched the web for faculty in my research area and cold-contacted them until one said yes. The project was a pivot from my graduate research to date to a topic I was more interested in. I hoped it would be productive; thus far, I had ridden along on projects run by other graduate students or by postdocs, uncertain when or how to start one on my own. Either way, the application had forced me to plan my first independent project.</p>

<p>I had navigated through Fastlane, NSF's grant proposal submission system, to submit the application. It seemed designed for much larger requests than mine---from professors seeking millions of dollars, not graduate students seeking a few thousand---and I had puzzled over obscure terminology and options. I wondered if they would ever become relevant to my work.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>February 14, 2009
<br/>Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</strong></p>

<p>I was visiting my girlfriend, a graduate student in Pittsburgh, when I learned I had received the fellowship to go to Australia. I had checked my email compulsively over the preceding two weeks, knowing the result would come soon. That afternoon, I pulled out my PDA---personal digital assistant, a precursor to a smartphone---and saw the message I was waiting for.</p>

<p>I began laughing and crying at the same time. My girlfriend was initially out of the room, but when she returned, she said it was "the most she had seen me laugh in a long time". I was in my fourth year of graduate school.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>June 1, 2011
<br/>Fredericksburg, Virginia</strong></p>

<p>Graduate school was six years for me, and afterward I moved back into my parents' house. I held no job offers. I had graduated feeling empty and uncertain whether I had accomplished anything of value; weeks earlier, a professor had been gravely dissatisfied with my work, to the extent they yelled their displeasure at my collaborators. My apartment lease ended on the last day of May, but I didn't have the energy or motivation to plan a proper move-out. I finished packing just after midnight, and exhausted, I made a last-minute decision spend the night at a nearby hotel rather than driving home.</p>

<p>Late in the morning on that first day of June I drove to my parents' house, still wearing yesterday's clothes. Because of my haphazard packing, all my clean clothes, and even my toothbrush and toothpaste, were inaccessible in my tightly packed car. At home I found that my parents were using my old room for storage, and it took a few hours for us to move around enough of their items that I could nominally move in. Even then I only had space to open suitcases and boxes, not to unpack them. The arrangement felt both temporary and indefinite.</p>

<p>In one box I found wax drops on several household items and traced them to an empty shot glass. I realized it had contained a candle that I received as a favor from a friend's wedding a few years prior. The summer afternoon heat in my car had melted the wax, and at some point the glass had tipped over. I sat holding the glass in my hand and thought about it for a long time. I had no particular use for the candle, but I was disappointed it didn't survive the move.</p>

<p>Later in the evening, I checked my email and received a rejection for a postdoc fellowship I had applied for. I had proposed to spend a year at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, a mecca for my field of research. It wasn't a complete surprise; a few weeks ago I had asked the granting organization for an update, and they disclosed it was unlikely I would win. Still, it was the post-graduation possibility I was most emotionally invested in. I had spent the southern-hemisphere winter in Australia in 2009 and summer 2010 in Singapore, and I wanted more time in other countries. I thought about people I had known in college who had studied abroad once, and how that time in their life was firmly in the past. I didn't want to be past those adventures yet, remembering how they had supported me through difficult times.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, my best prospect for a job involved a postdoc position I had discussed with a collaborator on a topic that I was secretly unexcited about. In a month I would learn whether they could extend me an offer, but my collaborator had been enthusiastic and all but promised one.</p>

<p>I knew I would resubmit the Edinburgh application in a few months, but I wondered what backdrop that would happen against. I was inexperienced with the postdoc job market, but the lack of an offer from my collaborator gave me the slightest pause.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>June 29, 2011
<br/>Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</strong></p>

<p>The collaborator couldn't extend me an offer. They said it was a budgetary issue, but I wondered if they had heard about the turbulence I encountered during the final stage of my PhD. I was visiting my girlfriend again, and I read the email in the morning while she slept in. I let her continue sleeping, and I waited until after she had finished her breakfast to tell her.</p>

<p>I was an unemployed recent PhD graduate with an underwhelming publication record and no substantial prospects for employment. Although I was visiting my girlfriend, I lived with my parents. I had wanted to become a professor, but absent incredible luck, my time in academia seemed over. The path had become very steep.</p>

<p>I thought about the application I would resubmit for the fellowship year in Edinburgh. The next submission deadline was a few months away, and it would take several more months to receive a reply. Winning the fellowship would be brilliant, but I needed something much sooner. In the meantime I would need to apply for positions in industry as a practical direction and postdoc positions in academia to try to find a way back in.</p>
