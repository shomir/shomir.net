<h2>IRFP</h2>
<p>From August 2013 through July 2014 I was a visiting postdoctoral researcher at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. I received funding for this trip from the National Science Foundation's <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5179">International Research Fellowship Program</a> (IRFP). IRFP was a great program, open to applicants in all NSF-funded areas of research, but it was discontinued immediately after I received my grant. NSF still funds some international postdoctoral research through <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/od/iia/ise/iprffapp.jsp">other programs</a>.</p>

<!-- <p>You can see some of my pictures from Scotland in an <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/115198616@N05/sets/72157648545566730/">album on Flickr</a>.</p> -->

<h2>EAPSI</h2>
<p>Twice during graduate school I received grants from the National Science Foundation's <a href="http://www.nsfsi.org/">East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes (EAPSI)</a>. These grants enabled me to spend two summers (June-August) abroad working on projects with researchers in Australia (2009) and Singapore (2010). Both summers were signature experiences in my graduate education: the Australia project served as an early stage of my dissertation work, and the Singapore project gave me a wider view of my research topic and its applications. Additionally, I continue to benefit from the networking I did while abroad.</p>

<p>As I describe below, these trips also provided many opportunities for sightseeing and adventures in distant parts of the world that I had long wanted to visit.</p>
