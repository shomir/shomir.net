<p>Lorem Ipsum.</p>

<h1>Scenes</h1>

<p>When I was a young child, at a reunion for the American side of my family, the topic of my Indian heritage came up. I had said nothing, but an elderly relative turned to me and said emphatically: "You may not think you have a lot in common with us, but you do." She looked at me for a long time, apparently wanting the message to sink in. I had thought I shared a lot in common with my American relatives; I barely knew my Indian relatives. I tried to smile, but I felt embarrassed and confused.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In elementary school, teachers and peers asked me where I was from. When I answered "Ohio", they seemed puzzled. I assumed I had answered the question incorrectly, and I began answering "India" instead. People seemed more satisfied. I continued using that answer through most of elementary school and middle school.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In middle school, a group of students decided to refer to me as a "broad-African booty scratcher". The epithet persisted for several months.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In middle school, a student in my grade asked: "You're Indian, right?"</p>

<p>I said yes.</p>

<p>He made an "ooh" sound with his mouth wide open and clapped his hand over it, producing a stereotypical Native American holler.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In middle school, a student yelled at me: "Go back to Mexico!"</p>

<p>On a different occasion, a student said I was an illegal immigrant and laughed.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In college, shortly after 9/11, an anonymous online account sent me a message describing me as a "Hindu-ass freak". (I am not Hindu.)</p>

<hr/>

<p>Briefly in college I had a goatee. A few months after 9/11, I overheard one of my friends tell another that I "really [did] look like a terrorist". Soon afterward I shaved the goatee.</p>
