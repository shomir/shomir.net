<h1>Read This First</h1>

<p>I've written this article for a wide range of ages, including young adults in middle school and high school. I would be glad if sharing my experiences helps other people understand theirs.</p>

<h1>Scenes, Part I</h1>

<blockquote>
  
<p>When I was a young child, at a reunion for the American side of my family, the topic of my Indian heritage came up. I had said nothing, but an elderly relative turned to me and said emphatically: "You may not think you have a lot in common with us, but you do." She looked at me for a long time, apparently wanting the message to sink in. I had thought I shared a lot in common with my American relatives; I barely knew my Indian relatives. I tried to smile, but I felt embarrassed and confused.</p>

<hr class="gray-thick"/>

<p>In elementary school, teachers and peers asked me where I was from. When I answered "Ohio", they seemed puzzled. I assumed I had answered the question incorrectly, and I began answering "India" instead. People seemed more satisfied. I continued using that answer through most of elementary school and middle school.</p>

<hr class="gray-thick"/>

<p>While riding my bicycle around my neighborhood, I passed by a yard where two siblings were playing. I overheard the girl, a few years older than me, explain to her younger brother that I was one of the "bad people" and he should never play with "people who look like that".</p>

<p>Several months later, during winter, my family's car got stuck in the snow on our street. Another car pulled over. I saw the same siblings look at me from the back seat, expressionless as their father stepped out and helped us dig out our car.</p>

<hr class="gray-thick"/>

<p>In middle school, a group of students decided to refer to me as a "broad-African booty scratcher". The epithet persisted for over a year.</p>

<hr class="gray-thick"/>

<p>In middle school, a student in my grade asked: "You're Indian, right?"</p>

<p>I said yes.</p>

<p>He made an "ooh" sound with his mouth wide open and clapped his hand over it, producing a stereotypical Native American holler.</p>

<hr class="gray-thick"/>

<p>In middle school, a student yelled at me: "Go back to Mexico!"</p>

<p>On a different occasion, a student said I was an illegal immigrant and laughed.</p>

<hr class="gray-thick"/>

<p>In high school, I briefly had a classmate whose family was from Pakistan. He was the only other person of South Asian ancestry in my classes, and some of my peers immediately assumed we were friends. I sensed our teacher thought the same. We got along fine, but we didn't have many opportunities to talk. A year later he moved to a different high school.</p>

<hr class="gray-thick"/>
  
<p>In high school, while attending a debate tournament held at a university, I saw a young Indian man walking across campus. I stared at him, marveling at how much he looked like me compared to everyone else I had ever met. He noticed my stare and said hello as he passed.</p>

<hr class="gray-thick"/>

<p>Later during my high school years, I visited India for the first time. At the end of the trip, while I waited in the departure lounge of Kolkata's airport, I watched a young India child repeat to himself over and over: "You are an American, not an Indian. You are an American, not an Indian. You are..."</p>

<h1>Places</h1>

<p>My first name, <em>Shomir</em>, reflects my heritage from India. My mother immigrated to the USA from West Bengal, where her ancestors lived as far back as I am aware. My last name, <em>Wilson</em>, reflects my mixed European heritage, though my father's family had been in the USA for several generations. Many lived in West Virginia, Ohio, and Illinois, with transatlantic origins in England, Ireland, Scotland, France, Germany, and the Netherlands.</p>

<p>I was born in Ohio, though soon afterward my family moved to Pennsylvania. I was too young to remember either of those time periods. We moved to Connecticut next, and my earliest memories come from there. After that we moved to Virginia, where I lived most of my childhood. </p>

<p>I was in college for five years at a university in Virginia, and I was in graduate school for six years at a university near Washington, DC. During graduate school I spent a winter living in Australia and a summer living in Singapore, both as a visiting researcher at universities there. </p>

<p>I held postdoc positions for two years at a university in Pennsylvania, then for one year in Scotland, and then back to Pennsylvania again for two years. My first faculty position was in Ohio, where I lived two years, and my second faculty position was in Pennsylvania. As of writing this, I've lived in Pennsylvania for the past six and a half years.</p>

<p>I am <em>from Ohio</em> in the sense that I was born there, though later in life I lived there a second time. I am <em>from Virginia</em> in the sense that I grew up there. I am <em>from Pennsylvania</em> in the sense that I currently live there, although I also lived there three times previously. I wouldn't say I'm from any of the other places I've lived, though I have significant memories from them. I also wouldn't say that I'm from India or Europe, but I have Indian and European heritage: my ancestors lived in those places and I inherit fragments of their cultures and aspects of their physical appearances.</p>
  
<h1>Scenes, Part II</h1>
  
<blockquote>
  
<p>In college, shortly after 9/11, an anonymous online account sent me a message describing me as a "Hindu-ass freak". (I am not Hindu.)</p>

<hr class="gray-thick"/>

<p>Briefly in college I had a goatee. A few months after 9/11, I overheard one of my friends tell another that I "really [did] look like a terrorist". Soon afterward I shaved the goatee.</p>

<hr class="gray-thick"/>

<p>Later in college, I was waiting for an elevator in the library. A man walked up to me, looked at me with intense curiosity, and asked: "Oh dear, tell me, where are you from?"</p>

<p>"Ohio", I said bluntly.</p>

<p>"Oh," he replied, deflated. "I guess it doesn't matter where any of us are from." He walked away.</p>

<hr class="gray-thick"/>

<p>Early in graduate school, I went for an evening walk in a nearby shopping mall. It was almost Christmas, and I noticed that the mall had a Black Santa. I suddenly realized that most of the mall patrons were Black. I thought: <em>I'm one of the few White people here.</em></p>

But then I wondered: <em>Am I White?</em>

<hr class="gray-thick"/>
  
<p>One summer during graduate school, my girlfriend and I were on a road trip in Louisiana. We stopped at a public park along the Mississippi River and walked across the park to the levee. Along the way, a man saw us and asked me: "Are you a terrorist?"</p>

<p>Reflexively, I said: "No."</p>

<p>He said: "Okay."</p>

<p>My girlfriend and I kept walking.</p>

<hr class="gray-thick"/>

<p>When I was a graduate student, I met with a professor who read my name aloud and remarked: "With a first name like that, you must be. . . Israeli?"</p>

<hr class="gray-thick"/>

<p>When I was a postdoc, during a conversation among two faculty and me, one said aside to the other that they weren't going to hire any of "those Indian masters students". They shared a laugh.</p>

<hr class="gray-thick"/>

<p>When I was traveling to interview for a faculty position, a woman staffing the hotel reception desk asked me: "Why is your last name 'Wilson'?"</p>

<p>I replied, "Why not?"</p>

<p>"Good answer," she said. She smiled and returned to typing on her computer. Later, she continued: "Let me guess: American father."</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied.</p>

<p>"Aha!" She seemed satisfied.</p>

<p>"My mother is an American, too."</p>

<p>She looked up, puzzled. "Okay, I'm not going to touch that one."</p>

<h1>People</h1>

<p>I'm an <em>American</em> by virtue of living in the USA nearly my entire life. My cultural identity largely comes from the USA, and especially from the mid-Atlantic region. I'm also an <em>Indian</em> and a <em>Bengali</em> by virtue of my mother's heritage, even though I'm not from India or Bengal.</p>

<p>I am both a <em>white</em> person and a <em>person of color</em>. To me, those terms are less about personal identity and more about how people see me. Sometimes white people treat me as one of them, and sometimes they don't. Similarly, sometimes people of color treat me as one of them, and sometimes they don't. The differences are most noticable when I first meet someone who knows very little about me. I observe subtle signs in their comfort, deference, and respect. Those signs disappear quickly or other circumstances replace them. For example, I speak more like a white person who grew up in the mid-Atlantic USA than I speak like an immigrant from India.</p>

<p>(Note that <em>Black</em> and <em>person of color</em> are different. <em>Person of color</em> simply means <em>not white</em>, and it includes people from many different backgrounds. Black people are people of color too, but I am not Black.)</p>

<p>During much of my childhood, I was confused by these aspects of my identity and what people expected of me. I had very little contact with other Indians my age, or more broadly, with other children of immigrants. My high school graduating class was mostly non-Hispanic white, with a minority of Black students and a small number of Hispanic students. I wasn't aware of anyone else in my class who had Asian parentage.</p>

<p>My peers were also confused by my identity, and some saw in me a target for verbal and physical abuse.</p>

<h1>Scenes, Part III</h1>
  
<blockquote>

<p>As a professor, I attended the opening reception for a large international conference. A graduate student asked me: "Where are you from?"</p>

<p>"The US," I said.</p>

<p>She persisted: "No, where are you <em>really</em> from?"</p>

<hr class="gray-thick"/>

<p>As I walked down a street in a major city, I passed a pair of Black men talking. One of them paused the conversation to nod to me and say: "What's up, Black brother?" </p>

<p>I said "Hi!" and kept walking. He misidentified me, but I felt honored.</p>

<hr class="gray-thick"/>

<p>A professor colleague who grew up in India learned that I had grown up in the US. He told me I was "not Indian".</p>

<hr class="gray-thick"/>

<p>A contractor visited our house (belonging to my wife and me) to give us a quote to repair its chimney. He asked how many languages I speak.</p>

<p>I said maybe one and a half.</p>

<p>He ventured to guess that I wasn't born in the US. I said I <em>was</em> born in the US.</p>

<p>He said I looked like I was from somewhere else, like the Middle East, and he mentioned the nearby university's large population of foreign students.</p>

<hr class="gray-thick"/>

<p>Late one evening, when my wife and I checked in at a hotel, the clerk scolded me for not greeting him in a language other than English that he assumed that he and I shared. I didn't know what it was. He then said I looked nervous, and he asked why. I told him I was tired and wanted my room. He repeated that I looked nervous, and emphasized at length that I was "safe [there]". </p>

<hr class="gray-thick"/>

<p>While I walked through a crowded train station in Turin, Italy, a police officer stopped me and asked to see my ID. Three other officers silently spread out to encircle around us. I handed over my passport, and the officer looked at it for a few minutes before handing it back to me and signaling wordlessly that I was free to go. I spent two hours in that station, but I saw no one else confronted. That was the only time during that trip that I saw an assembly of four police officers confronting a single person.</p>

<hr class="gray-thick"/>

<p>A bagger at a supermarket asked me, "Hey, are you from Brazil?" I said no. He said that I looked just like a man he knew from Brazil, and that it was a place where people danced like monkeys and juggled fruit.</p>

<hr class="gray-thick"/>

<p>At an international conference, a professor of Indian ancestry who was based at a university in the USA spoke to me about problems with her residency status. She then apologized, thinking she had wrongly excluded me, and said that I must experience the same obstacles. I clarified that I'm an American citizen.</p>
