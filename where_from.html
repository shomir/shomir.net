<p>Lorem Ipsum.</p>

<h1>Scenes</h1>

<p>When I was a young child, at a reunion for the American side of my family, the topic of my Indian heritage came up. I had said nothing, but an elderly relative turned to me and said emphatically: "You may not think you have a lot in common with us, but you do." She looked at me for a long time, apparently wanting the message to sink in. I had thought I shared a lot in common with my American relatives; I barely knew my Indian relatives. I tried to smile, but I felt embarrassed and confused.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In elementary school, teachers and peers asked me where I was from. When I answered "Ohio", they seemed puzzled. I assumed I had answered the question incorrectly, and I began answering "India" instead. People seemed more satisfied. I continued using that answer through most of elementary school and middle school.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In middle school, a group of students decided to refer to me as a "broad-African booty scratcher". The epithet persisted for several months.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In middle school, a student in my grade asked: "You're Indian, right?"</p>

<p>I said yes.</p>

<p>He made an "ooh" sound with his mouth wide open and clapped his hand over it, producing a stereotypical Native American holler.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In middle school, a student yelled at me: "Go back to Mexico!"</p>

<p>On a different occasion, a student said I was an illegal immigrant and laughed.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In high school, I briefly had a classmate whose family was from Pakistan. He was the only other person of South Asian ancestry in my classes, and some of my peers acted as if we had immediately become friends. I sensed our teacher thought the same. We got along fine, but we didn't have many opportunities to talk. A year later he moved to a different high school.</p>

<hr/>
  
<p>In high school, while attending a debate tournament held at a university, I saw a young Indian man walking across campus. I stared at him, marveling at how much he looked like me compared to everyone else I had met. He noticed my stare and said hello as he passed.</p>

<hr/>
  
<p>In college, shortly after 9/11, an anonymous online account sent me a message describing me as a "Hindu-ass freak". (I am not Hindu.)</p>

<hr/>

<p>Briefly in college I had a goatee. A few months after 9/11, I overheard one of my friends tell another that I "really [did] look like a terrorist". Soon afterward I shaved the goatee.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Later in college, I was waiting for an elevator in the library. A man walked up to me looked at me with intense curiosity, and asked: "Oh dear, tell me, where are you from?"</p>

<p>"Ohio", I said bluntly.</p>

<p>"Oh," he replied, deflated. "I guess it doesn't matter where any of us are from."</p>

<hr/>

<p>Early in graduate school, I went for an evening walk in a nearby shopping mall. It was almost Christmas, and I noticed that the mall had a Black Santa. I suddenly realized that most of the mall patrons were Black. I thought: <em>I'm one of the few White people here.</em></p>

But then I wondered: <em>Am I White?</em>
