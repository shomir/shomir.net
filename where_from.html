<p>Lorem Ipsum.</p>

<h1>Scenes</h1>

<p>When I was a young child, at a reunion for the American side of my family, the topic of my Indian heritage came up. I had said nothing, but an elderly relative turned to me and said emphatically: "You may not think you have a lot in common with us, but you do." She looked at me for a long time, apparently wanting the message to sink in. I had thought I shared a lot in common with my American relatives; I barely knew my Indian relatives. I tried to smile, but I felt embarrassed and confused.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In elementary school, teachers and peers asked me where I was from. When I answered "Ohio", they seemed puzzled. I assumed I had answered the question incorrectly, and I began answering "India" instead. People seemed more satisfied. I continued using that answer through most of elementary school and middle school.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In middle school, a group of students decided to refer to me as a "broad-African booty scratcher". The epithet persisted for several months.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In middle school, a student in my grade asked: "You're Indian, right?"</p>

<p>I said yes.</p>

<p>He made an "ooh" sound with his mouth wide open and clapped his hand over it, producing a stereotypical Native American holler.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In middle school, a student yelled at me: "Go back to Mexico!"</p>

<p>On a different occasion, a student said I was an illegal immigrant and laughed.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In high school, I briefly had a classmate whose family was from Pakistan. He was the only other person of South Asian ancestry in my classes, and some of my peers acted as if we had immediately become friends. I sensed our teacher thought the same. We got along fine, but we didn't have many opportunities to talk. A year later he moved to a different high school.</p>

<hr/>
  
<p>In high school, while attending a debate tournament held at a university, I saw a young Indian man walking across campus. I stared at him, marveling at how much he looked like me compared to everyone else I had met. He noticed my stare and said hello as he passed.</p>

<hr/>
  
<p>In college, shortly after 9/11, an anonymous online account sent me a message describing me as a "Hindu-ass freak". (I am not Hindu.)</p>

<hr/>

<p>Briefly in college I had a goatee. A few months after 9/11, I overheard one of my friends tell another that I "really [did] look like a terrorist". Soon afterward I shaved the goatee.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Later in college, I was waiting for an elevator in the library. A man walked up to me looked at me with intense curiosity, and asked: "Oh dear, tell me, where are you from?"</p>

<p>"Ohio", I said bluntly.</p>

<p>"Oh," he replied, deflated. "I guess it doesn't matter where any of us are from."</p>

<hr/>

<p>Early in graduate school, I went for an evening walk in a nearby shopping mall. It was almost Christmas, and I noticed that the mall had a Black Santa. I suddenly realized that most of the mall patrons were Black. I thought: <em>I'm one of the few White people here.</em></p>

But then I wondered: <em>Am I White?</em>

<hr/>
<p>One summer during graduate school, my girlfriend and I were on a road trip in Louisiana. We stopped at a public park along the Mississippi River and walked across the park to the levee. Along the way, a man saw us and asked me: "Are you a terrorist?"</p>

<p>Reflexively, I said: "No."</p>

<p>He said: "Okay."</p>

<p>My girlfriend and I kept walking.</p>

  <hr/>

  <p>When I was a graduate student, I met with a professor who read my name aloud and remarked: "With a first name like that, you must be. . . Israeli?"</p>

  <hr/>

  <p>When I was a postdoc, during a conversation with two faculty, one said to the other that they weren't going to hire any of "those Indian masters students". They shared a laugh.</p>

  <hr/>

  <p>When I was traveling for a faculty interview, a woman staffing the hotel reception desk asked me: "Why is your last name 'Wilson'?"</p>

<p>I replied, "Why not?"</p>

<p>"Good answer," she said. She smiled and returned to typing on her computer. Later, she continued: "Let me guess: American father."</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied.</p>

<p>"Aha!" She seemed satisfied.</p>

<p>"My mother is an American, too."</p>

<p>She looked up, puzzled. "Okay, I'm not going to touch that one."</p>

  <hr/>

  <p>I was a professor at the opening reception for a large international conference. A graduate student asked me: "Where are you from?"</p>

<p>"The US," I said.</p>

<p>She persisted: "No, where are you <em>really</em> from?"</p>

  <hr/>

  <p>As I walked down a street in a major city, I passed a pair of Black men talking. One of them saw me approach and paused the conversation to say to me: "What's up, Black brother?" </p>

<p>I said "Hi!" and kept walking. They misidentified me, but I felt honored.</p>

  <hr/>

  <p>A professor colleague who grew up in India learned that I had grown up in the US. He told me I was "not Indian".</p>

  <hr/>

  <p>A contractor visited our house (belonging to my wife and me) to give us a quote to repair its chimney. He asked how many languages I speak.</p>

<p>I said maybe one and a half.</p>

<p>He ventured to guess that I wasn't born in the US. I said I was born in the US.</p>

<p>He said I looked like I was from somewhere else, like the Middle East, and he mentioned the nearby university's large population of foreign students.</p>

  <hr/>

  <p>When my wife and I checked in at a hotel, the clerk scolded me for not greeting him in a language other than English that he assumed that he and I shared. I didn't know what it was. He then said I looked nervous, and he asked why. I told him I was tired and wanted my room. He emphasized that I looked nervous, and said repeatedly that I was "safe [there]". </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>While I walked through a crowded train station in Turin, Italy, a uniformed officer stopped me and asked to see my ID. Three other officers with him silently spread out to encircle around us. I handed over my passport, and the officer looked at it for a few minutes before handing it back to me and signaling wordlessly that I was free to go. I spent two hours in that station, but I saw no one else confronted. That was the only time during that trip that I saw an assembly of four police officers confronting a single person.</p>

  <hr/>

  <p>A bagger at a supermarket asked me, "Hey, are you from Brazil?" I said no. He said that I looked just like a man he knew from Brazil, and that it was a place where people danced like monkeys and juggled fruit.</p>

  <hr/>

  <p>At an international conference, a professor of Indian ancestry who was based at a university in the USA spoke to me about problems with her residency status. She then apologized, thinking she had wrongly excluded me, and said that I must experience the same obstacles. I clarified that I'm an American citizen.</p>
