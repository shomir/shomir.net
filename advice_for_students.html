  <p><strong>I created these guides to help students understand often-unwritten customs and procedures in academia.</strong> I encourage my students to read these guides, but you're welcome to <a href="index.html">contact me</a> if you have questions about them.

  <h1>Academia</h1>

  <p>The <strong><a href="teaching_faq.html">Guide for Interacting With Faculty</a></strong> is for people (especially first-year undergraduates and international students) who want to learn about expectations that university faculty have for them.</p>

  <p>The <strong><a href="scholarly_publishing.html">Guide for Publishing in Conferences and Attending Them</a></strong> is for students who want to share their work with the research community.</p>

  <p>The <strong><a href="tt_job_guide.html">Guide for the Tenure-Track Job Market in Computer/Information Sciences</a></strong> is for people (students and others) who want to apply for faculty positions.</p>

  <h1>Writing</h1>

  <p>The <strong><a href="scholarly_writing.html">Guide for Scholarly Writing</a></strong> is for students who are writing manuscripts for assignments or for publication.</p>

  <p>The <strong><a href="citations_and_references.html">Guide for Citations and References</a></strong> is for students who are new to using citations and references, or need to refresh their memory.</p>

  <h1>My Lab</h1>

  <p>The <strong><a href="advising_faq.html">Guide for Joining My Lab</a></strong> is for prospective students and visitors who are interested in doing research with me. It also contains some general guidance on graduate school in computer science and information science.</p>

  <p>The <strong><a href="lab_resources.html">Guide for Lab Resources</a></strong> is for my current research advisees.</p>

  <h1>My Experiences</h1>

  <p><strong><a href="failure.html">Thoughts on Failure</a></strong> is a personal narrative about my biggest failures, with some advice from experience. Students who set challenging goals for themselves may find the contents of this page particularly relatable.</p>

  <p>Work-life balance is important. I wrote <strong><a href="photography_thoughts.html">Thoughts on Photography</a></strong> to share the creative process behind the pictures throughout these guides.</p>

  <h1>Quick Replies</h1>

  <p><strong><a href="need_help.html">Need Help?</a></strong> is a page I sometimes send as a reply to prospective research advisees who need help formulating their questions. I encourage other faculty to reply with a page like this when necessary, rather than ignoring prospectives' emails.</p>

  <p><strong><a href="emailing_a_professor.html">Emailing a Professor: How to do it Well</a></strong> is a page I sometimes send as a reply to students who will benefit from tips on professional email etiquette. I wrote it so that other faculty can use it too.</p>
