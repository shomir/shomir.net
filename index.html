    <p><strong>I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://ist.psu.edu/">College of Information Sciences and Technology</a> at <a href="https://www.psu.edu/">Penn State</a>, where I lead the <a href="https://hltlab.org">Human Language Technologies Lab</a>.</strong> I am also a Faculty Affiliate of Penn State's <a href="https://ics.psu.edu/">Institute for Computational and Data Sciences</a> and a member of the <a href="http://bdss.psu.edu/">Social Data Analytics</a> graduate faculty.</p>
  <p><strong>My research spans natural language processing, privacy, and artificial intelligence.</strong> I participate in the <a href="http://www.usableprivacy.org/">Usable Privacy Policy Project</a>. You can read more about my <a href="research.html">research interests</a>.</p>
  <!--<p>You can read more about my <a href="research.html">research interests</a> and my <a href=teaching.html>teaching experience</a>.</p> -->
    <p>From 2016 until 2018 I was an Assistant Professor in the <a href="http://eecs.ceas.uc.edu/">EECS Department</a> at the <a href="http://www.uc.edu/">University of Cincinnati</a>. Prior to that I was a postdoc and a lecturer in <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>'s <a href="http://scs.cmu.edu/">School of Computer Science</a> and an NSF International Research Fellow in the <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/">University of Edinburgh</a>'s <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics">School of Informatics</a>.
