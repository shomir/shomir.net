<h1>Latest News</h1>
    <p><strong>2018-05-07: </strong>I was a faculty marshal for the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences at UC's Spring Commencement. Congratulations again to all of our graduates!</p>
    <p><strong>2018-03-23: </strong>The Usable Privacy Policy Project created a series of <a href="https://usableprivacy.org/videos">videos</a> to explain our research. I speak first in <a href="https://youtu.be/L-Ip7F96mbo">this one</a>, about the natural language processing aspects of the project.</p>
    <p><strong>2018-03-01: </strong>Our work is featured in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=244730&WT.mc_id=USNSF_195">NSF News from the Field</a>. See the bottom of the press release (linked from the NSF article) for the full list of collaborators.</p>
    <p><strong>2018-02-17: </strong>I am proposing a workshop titled "AI and NLP for Usable Privacy" at <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/soups2018">SOUPS</a> this coming August. The workshop will be a successor event to <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/fsplt2016/">Privacy and Language Technologies</a>, the AAAI Fall Symposium I organized in 2016. Contact me if you have nominations (including self-nominations) for the program committee.</p>
    <p><strong>2018-02-12: </strong>Congrats to my M.S. student Kaitlin Burnam on winning the graduate student poster award at the <a href="http://triwic.acm.org/">Tri-State Women in Computing Conference</a> this past weekend!</p>
    <p><strong>2018-02-02: </strong>During the week of March 12, I will teach a mini-course titled "Ethics of Artificial Intelligence" at Future University in Cairo, Egypt.</p>
    <p><strong>2018-01-25: </strong>Check out <a href="https://explore.usableprivacy.org/">our re-launch of the Explore site</a>, now featuring over 7,000 automatically annotated privacy policies.</p>
    <p><strong>2017-11-14: </strong>Cincinnati's Channel 9 News <a href="http://www.wcpo.com/money/consumer/dont-waste-your-money/apples-iphone-facial-id-defeated-by-10-year-old">interviewed</a> me today about FaceID in the iPhone X. (Skip to 1:00 in the video for the correct story.) A few claims in the segment that aired were misattributed to me, although I was still glad to speak with them. Also, although they cited me as a face recognition expert, this is incorrect; I spoke as a privacy researcher.</p>
