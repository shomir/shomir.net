<h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science in the <a href="http://eecs.ceas.uc.edu/">EECS Department</a> of the <a href="http://www.uc.edu/">University of Cincinnati</a>. I lead the Human Language Technologies Lab and I am a member of the University of Cincinnati Institute for Analytics Innovation.</p>
        <p>Previously I held postdoctoral and lecturer positions in Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science, and prior to that I was an NSF International Research Fellow in the University of Edinburgh's School of Informatics. I received my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Maryland in 2011.
        <p>My research spans natural language processing, privacy, and artificial intelligence. Recently a focus of my work has been the <a href="http://www.usableprivacy.org/">Usable Privacy Policy Project</a>.</p>

<p>You can read more about my <a href="research.html">research interests</a> and my <a href=teaching.html>teaching experience</a>.</p>

<!--My work in these areas shares a common theme of <em>information introspection</em>: solving problems with metareasoning (i.e., the ability to think about and modify one's reasoning) sourced both from computing technologies and from their users. Read about my interests <a href="research.html">here</a>.</p>-->

<!--<h2>Teaching</h2>
        <p>In spring 2015 I co-taught <a href="http://demo.clab.cs.cmu.edu/NLP/">11-411/611 Natural Language Processing</a> with <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cdyer/">Chris Dyer</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awb/">Alan Black</a>.</p>
	<p>The course included a semester-long project to build question answering and question generation systems that operate on Wikipedia articles. Students worked in small teams of three to five, and they competed to produce the best-performing systems. You can watch the final reports from the top three teams <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuSXabda8uM">here</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0H9RYnh2ScU&feature=em-share_video_user">here</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Sk2xMqLikw&feature=em-share_video_user">here</a>.</p>-->

        <!--<p>I received my Ph.D. (2011) and M.S. (2008) from the <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a> at the <a href="http://www.umd.edu/">University of Maryland</a>, where I was a student with the <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/active/">ALMECOM Lab</a>. My supervisor there was <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~perlis/">Donald Perlis</a>.</p>
        <p>I received my undergraduate education at <a href="http://www.vt.edu">Virginia Tech</a>, where in 2005 I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science, a B.S. in Mathematics, and a B.A. in Philosophy.</p>-->

<h2>Curriculum Vitae</h2>
<p>Have a look <a href="pdf/portfolio/shomir_wilson_cv_web.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Recruiting</h2>
<p><strong>Prospective Ph.D. Students:</strong> I have openings for one or two Ph.D. students to work on projects related to natural language processing, in particular on online privacy or entity linking. I'm looking for students who have coursework in NLP and machine learning, and I place a high value on good writing skills and attentiveness to detail. If you're interested in working with me, read some of my recent publications and email me with "Potential PhD student--read your news item" as the subject line.</p>
<p><strong>Prospective Postdocs:</strong> I am looking for a recent or soon-to-be Ph.D. to apply for the <a href="http://orau.org/icpostdoc/default.html">IC Postdoctoral Research Fellowship Program</a>, for <a href="https://www.zintellect.com/Posting/Details/2928">calculus of privacy</a> or <a href="https://www.zintellect.com/Posting/Details/2911">data science methods</a>. If you are interested and eligible (<a href="http://orau.org/icpostdoc/applicants.html">check here</a>), read some of my recent publications and email me with "Potential postdoc--read your news item" as the subject line. Keep in mind that the application deadline is March 31.</p>
