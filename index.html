    <p><strong>I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://ist.psu.edu/">College of Information Sciences and Technology</a> at <a href="https://www.psu.edu/">Penn State</a>, where I lead the <a href="https://hltlab.org">Human Language Technologies Lab</a>.</strong> I am also a Faculty Affiliate of Penn State's <a href="https://ics.psu.edu/">Institute for CyberScience</a> and a member of the faculty of the Graduate School.</p>
  <p><strong>My research spans natural language processing, privacy, and artificial intelligence.</strong> I participate in the <a href="http://www.usableprivacy.org/">Usable Privacy Policy Project</a>. You can read more about my <a href="research.html">research interests</a>.</p>
  <!--<p>You can read more about my <a href="research.html">research interests</a> and my <a href=teaching.html>teaching experience</a>.</p> -->
    <p>From 2016 until 2018 I was an Assistant Professor in the <a href="http://eecs.ceas.uc.edu/">EECS Department</a> at the <a href="http://www.uc.edu/">University of Cincinnati</a>. Prior to that I was a postdoc and a lecturer in <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>'s <a href="http://scs.cmu.edu/">School of Computer Science</a> and an NSF International Research Fellow in the <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/">University of Edinburgh</a>'s <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics">School of Informatics</a>. I received my PhD in Computer Science from the <a href="https://www.umd.edu/">University of Maryland</a> in 2011.

    <h1>Contacting Me</h1>
    <p><strong>You can reach me at shomir _at_ psu.edu.</strong> If you are on PSU's University Park campus, you can stop by my office at E310 in the Westgate Building.</p>
    <p><strong>Prospective Students:</strong> I have openings for Ph.D. students, M.S. students, and undergraduates to work on projects related to natural language processing or privacy. I'm looking for students who have coursework in machine learning, NLP, or artificial intelligence, and I place a high value on good writing skills and attentiveness to detail. If you're interested in working with me, read some of my recent publications and email me with "read your recruiting note" as the subject line. Include a CV and an explanation of your specific interests in my research.</p>
    <!-- <p>I do not have short-term (e.g., single semester or summer length) research positions ("internships") for students who are visiting from other universities. I receive many inquiries about this and I may not be able to respond to all of them.</p> -->
