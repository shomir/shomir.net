    <p><strong>I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://ist.psu.edu/">College of Information Sciences and Technology</a> at <a href="https://www.psu.edu/">Penn State</a>, where I lead the <a href="https://hltlab.org">Human Language Technologies Lab</a>.</strong> I am also a Faculty Affiliate of Penn State's <a href="https://ics.psu.edu/">Institute for Computational and Data Sciences</a> and a member of the <a href="http://bdss.psu.edu/">Social Data Analytics</a> graduate faculty.</p>
  <p><strong>My research spans natural language processing, privacy, and artificial intelligence.</strong> I participate in the <a href="http://www.usableprivacy.org/">Usable Privacy Policy Project</a>. You can read more about my <a href="research.html">research interests</a>.</p>
  <!--<p>You can read more about my <a href="research.html">research interests</a> and my <a href=teaching.html>teaching experience</a>.</p> -->
    <p>From 2016 until 2018 I was an Assistant Professor in the <a href="http://eecs.ceas.uc.edu/">EECS Department</a> at the <a href="http://www.uc.edu/">University of Cincinnati</a>. Prior to that I was a postdoc and a lecturer in <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>'s <a href="http://scs.cmu.edu/">School of Computer Science</a> and an NSF International Research Fellow in the <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/">University of Edinburgh</a>'s <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics">School of Informatics</a>. I received my PhD in Computer Science from the <a href="https://www.umd.edu/">University of Maryland</a> in 2011.

    <h1>Contacting Me</h1>
    <p><strong>You can reach me at shomir _at_ psu.edu.</strong> If you are on Penn State's University Park campus, you can stop by my office at E310 in the Westgate Building.</p>
    <p><strong>Students taking my classes</strong> may benefit from browsing my <a href="teaching_faq.html">Guide for Interacting With Faculty</a> before contacting me.</p>
    <p><strong>Students interested in joining my lab:</strong> I often have openings for PhD students, MS students, and undergraduates to work on projects related to natural language processing or privacy. If you're interested in working with me, first consult my <a href="advising_faq.html">Guide for Joining My Lab</a> and then email me with "read your recruiting note" as the subject line. Include a CV and an explanation of your specific interests in my research.</p>
    <!-- <p><strong>Those looking for postdoc positions:</strong> I currently have no funding for postdocs. If you have a PhD and you are interested in an unfunded visiting position, see my <a href="advising_faq.html">Advising FAQ</a>.</p> -->
    <!-- <p>I do not have short-term (e.g., single semester or summer length) research positions ("internships") for students who are visiting from other universities. I receive many inquiries about this and I may not be able to respond to all of them.</p> -->

    <p><strong>2019-12-01: </strong>I recently attended two events: <a href="https://publish.illinois.edu/nsf-broadening-participation/">an NSF Workshop</a> on Departmental Plans for Broadening Participation in Computer Science, where I was one of two faculty representing the College of IST, and a Penn State - University of Auckland research collaboration development workshop.</p>
    <p><strong>2019-11-11: </strong><a href="https://issuu.com/istpsu/docs/iconnect-fall-2019">The Fall 2019 issue of iConnect</a>, the College of IST's magazine, contains a synopsis of my recent work to simplify online privacy using artificial intelligence. It's on page 22.</p>
    <p><strong>2019-10-25: </strong>I gave a talk for Graduates in IST about finding an academic job. Most of the talk was based upon material in my <a href="tt_job_guide.html">Guide for the Tenure-Track Job Market in Computer/Information Sciences</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>2019-09-24: </strong>I wrote a <a href="https://shomir.net/citations_and_references.html">Guide to Citations and References</a> for students who are new to using citations and references, or need to refresh their memory.

    <p><strong>2019-09-17: </strong>I will lead a breakout session titled "Making Privacy Understandable for Internet Users" at the NSF SaTC PI Meeting in Alexandria on October 27-29.
