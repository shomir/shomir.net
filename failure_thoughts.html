  <h1>Read This First</h1>

  <p>I created this page to share my thoughts about failure with my students. My education and early career contained many failures, and my experiences may be useful to consider and compare to your own. I've focused on failures at the boundaries between stages of education or professional development, when one's future is acutely uncertain. Competition is also a recurring theme in the circumstances I describe. Students who set challenging goals for themselves may find the contents of this page particularly relatable.</p>

  <p>This page shares some themes with a <a href="miscellany.html#section_vt_phil_speech">graduation speech</a> I gave in 2019 for a department at my undergraduate alma mater.</p>

  <h1>Privilege and Luck</h1>

  <p>Throughout the chronicle below, I had supportive parents, a supportive partner, a stable financial situation, and good health. I belong to privileged demographics for gender and race. All of these factors helped me to recover from failures and to take advantage of new opportunities.</p>

  <p>I was also lucky: seemingly small decisions made by myself and others sometimes had a huge influence on outcomes. It’s possible that luck causes my advice to contain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias">survivor bias</a>, although I’ve tried to avoid it by describing a large number of failures. The number of years I’ve accumulated unsuccessfully applying for things suggests that I’ve perished many more years than I’ve survived. My work and preparation gave me the chance to compete, but luck was always involved in the outcome.</p>

  <p>Privilege and luck are intertwined. Privilege makes it easier to take advantage of luck, and luck yields more privilege. One of the reasons I created <a href="advice_for_students.html">Advice for Students</a> is to reduce the role of privileged knowledge  in this cycle.</p>

  <h1>Chronicle</h1>

  <h3>Success: I Did Well in High School and College</h3>

  <p>In high school, I was a debate team captain and a scholastic bowl team captain. I received awards when I graduated: Outstanding Senior in Computer Science, Outstanding Senior in English, Salutatorian, and Student of the Year.</p>

  <p>In college I triple-majored in computer science, mathematics, and philosophy. Academically, I sometimes pushed myself too far. (Ambitious undergraduates, remember that college should be challenging but not impossible.) I won several small scholarships from my university, though I wasn't successful with major national scholarships. I applied for <a href="https://goldwater.scholarsapply.org/">Goldwater</a> and didn't get it. Although I wanted to be the kind of student who competed for <a href="https://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/">Rhodes</a> and <a href="https://www.marshallscholarship.org/">Marshall</a>, I didn't build the portfolio of experiences to create a compelling application.</p>

  <p>In my fourth year, I was set to earn honors baccalaureate degrees for each of my three  majors, and I received the philosophy department's graduating senior award. I submitted applications to eight graduate programs in computer science and for <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/">NSF's GRFP</a>. I didn't get GRFP, but by the time I received the rejection I had greater concerns.</p>

  <h3>Failure: My First Round of Graduate School Applications Didn't Go Well</h3>

  <p>All but one of my graduate school applications were rejected, and the remaining one was for a program that I realized was a poor fit for my interests. I asked my faculty mentors to check over my application materials and they found nothing wrong with them. Their conclusion was that I had been very unlucky.</p>

  <p>I took a special opportunity to stay on for a fifth year as an undergraduate, to improve my portfolio. I rewrote my personal statement, and I retook the GREs to receive a slightly higher score. Again, I sent out eight applications to graduate programs. This time I received admission to three, including two that flipped from rejections the previous year. I accepted an offer from one of them.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, my undergraduate computer science department selected me as the outstanding senior of the year, and I graduated.</p>

  <p>I applied for NSF GRFP a second time and received a second rejection.</p3>

  <p>* * * (picture of rejection and acceptance from UMD)</p>

  <h3>Success: I Survived Graduate School and Earned My PhD</h3>

  <p>In graduate school, I received two <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2013/nsf13593/nsf13593.htm">NSF EAPSI</a> fellowships to spend a winter in Australia and a summer in Singapore. I published, and I accumulated a moderately successful portfolio. (Ambitious graduate students, remember that it's more difficult to be a superstar at this stage of your education than in any previous stage. Focus instead on graduating.) I wrote a dissertation that my committee approved after some revisions.</p>

  <p>A collaborator wanted to hire me as a postdoc, and he asked me to apply for an opening with his lab. I also applied for two postdoctoral fellowships to work on projects of my own choosing.</p>

  <p>I graduated without an employment offer in hand, but the postdoc with my collaborator was nearly certain to happen. Alternatively, if I received either of the fellowships, they would take me to interesting places.</p>

  <h3>Failure: None of My Original Post-PhD Employment Plans Came to Fruition</h3>

  <p>Soon after I graduated, I was rejected for the postdoc position with my collaborator. An internal misunderstanding about funding meant their organization couldn't hire me. The two fellowships also rejected me.</p>

  <p>I spent the summer unemployed, searching for a job. Although I wanted to stay on an academic career track, I also submitted applications to a variety of positions in government and industry. Early on, I received offers for positions that struck me as suspicious; painfully and without alternatives, I turned them down. Later, I was rejected for a variety of postdoc positions inside and outside of my area of research. I was the rare computer scientist who couldn't find a job.</p>

  <p>As the summer wore on and I applied to a wider variety of positions, I tried to entertain the idea of work as less of a calling and instead chiefly a way to make money. I couldn't do it. Some people can manage it, and I think it's a valuable capability, but I it wasn't something that I had.</p>

  <p>Toward the end of summer, a combination of luck and due diligence saved me.</p>

  <p>A friend sent me an ad for a postdoc position that I had already seen; I had previously decided it was both out of my area and out of my league. Grudgingly, I applied. Astoundingly, they took me seriously, interviewed me, and sent me an offer. I accepted it. The position was a great fit for me professionally and for my geographic preferences.</p>

  <p>Coincidentally, it was at a university that had twice rejected my applications to their PhD program.</p>

  <h3>Success: I Was a Productive, Successful Postdoc</h3>

  <p>The postdoc position expanded my research portfolio in a new direction, and I worked with supportive collaborators, published in major venues, and built a professional network. I gained experience mentoring students and applying for grants. I also spent a year abroad on a fellowship, satisfying a long-standing personal goal. It was actually one of the same fellowships that had rejected me just after I graduated; I reapplied and won it as part of the last cohort before the program was discontinued. Outside of work, I also got married, traveled, lived in great places, and made lasting friendships.</p>

  <p>A typical postdoc position lasts just 2-3 years, and it's intended to build one's professional portfolio while applying for non-temporary positions. I remembered as a graduate student wondering how postdocs coped with the uncertainty of not knowing what kind of job they would get next, where they would live, and more generally, what their lives would be like. The postdocs I knew as a graduate student seemed nonchalant about the uncertainty.</p>

  <p>I might have appeared nonchalant for awhile too, but as time wore on, I became more concerned.</p>

  <h3>Failure: My First Three Years on the Faculty Job Market Produced Zero Offers</h3>

  <p><a href="tt_job_guide.html">The CS/IS faculty job market observes an annual cycle</a>, with applications due in the fall and interviews during the following spring. Early on as a postdoc, I planned a three-year strategy for my applications. During my first cycle I would apply for only the openings I most wanted. If I didn't receive an offer, I would apply for a larger number of openings during the second cycle. If I still didn't receive an offer, I would apply for an even larger number during the third cycle. My mentors agreed it was a good plan.</p>

  <p>During those application cycles I received zero, two, and one phone interviews, respectively. No one invited me to interview on campus, and I received no offers.</p>

  <p>To my knowledge, it is rare for applicants to be able to spend this many years in a row on the faculty job market. They either exit the market with an offer or life circumstances force them to choose a different career path. I was privileged and lucky to be able to continue applying, but I was unlucky with the results.</p>

  <p>I decided to try a fourth cycle, and the number of applications that I turned in exceeded the sum of my first three cycles combined. One day I submitted so many applications that I had to stop in the evening because the thought of submitting one more made me feel physically ill. However, I reached a breakthrough, with six on-campus interviews. I received multiple offers, and I accepted one. Notably, the academic unit that I joined had rejected my application during a previous hiring cycle.</p>

  <p>I spent two years there and then moved to a different university for another tenure-track position, one was a better fit for me. This second academic unit had rejected my application twice during previous hiring cycles.</p>

  <h3>I Have More Failures</h3>

  <p>I've omitted a few other failures that were nearly as painful but didn't happen at crucial pivot points in my education and career.</p>

  <h1>Reflections</h1>

  <h3>Accumulation of Failure Does Not Prevent Future Success</h3>

  <p>Some of these examples appear in the narrative above, and others don't.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I flipped two graduate admissions decisions with my second batch of applications.</li>
    <li>As a postdoc, one of the academic units that I worked in had rejected two of my PhD program applications.</li>
    <li>The fellowship that sent me abroad for a year had rejected my application during the previous application cycle.</li>
    <li>One academic unit gave me a phone interview for a faculty position, declined to proceed with my application, and then gave me a second phone interview three years later.</li>
    <li>My first faculty position was in an academic unit that had previously rejected one of my faculty applications.</li>
    <li>My second faculty position was in an academic unit that had rejected my job applications twice before.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>A few months after I moved to my second faculty position, I received a rejection letter from my new academic unit. I had applied for multiple openings, and the rejection was automatically generated for one of the others. I had actually applied for four different faculty positions in the same academic unit, but it was sufficient to have just one of my applications be successful.</p>

  <h3>Maintaining Perspective</h3>

  <p>Your memory of your failures will exceed anyone else's, and it's unlikely that anyone evaluating your work will witnesses more than a small fraction of them. Even within a specific, sited instance of a year-to-year competition (e.g., admissions to a specific academic unit's PhD program), committees considering your application tend not to remember. They read large numbers of applications, and some members change every year.</p>

  <p>To the extent that they notice, committees are more likely to think of repeat applications as a positive rather than a negative. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grit_(personality_trait)">Grit</a> is recognized as a valuable trait, and sustained interest in an opportunity is seen as a plus for a candidate.</p>

  <p>The weight you feel when remembering your failures is real, and its accumulation can take a toll on your mental health. Self-care is appropriate. It's also appropriate to resist the urge to express a pre-emptive defensiveness when you prepare a portfolio of your work or talk with people about your experiences.</p>

  <h3>Finding Meaning</h3>

  <p>Here, <em>meaning</em> is about narrative rather than semantics. A sense of narrative adds value to experiences, although it may take awhile to find.</p>

  <p>Creative expression, either shared or private, can be a conduit for finding meaning. In written or spoken contexts, it's a good sign if what you say <em>sounds like you</em>: it's easy to produce rose-colored insincerity and highfalutin claims when asked to find meaning in failure. Again, constructing meaning takes time, and feeling positive about a failure might not be as productive of a goal as feeling satisfied.</p>

  <p>It took me a year or two to find meaning in some of the failures I’ve described, but the narrative is an asset. When I write or speak for an audience, regardless of topic, my failures steady my words in a way that I find difficult to explain. My failures also give me stories to tell my students, sometimes to reassure them and other times to make them laugh.</p>

  <h3>Sources of Motivation</h3>

  <p>What motivated you prior to a failure? Options include (but are not limited to) ambition, longing, popularity, prestige, love, fear, outrage, duty, vindication, absolution, money, obligation to others, and obligation to yourself. Each of these options is morally ambiguous: it's possible to do a good thing for bad reasons, or to do a bad thing for good reasons. In graduate school, my motivation for applying for my first fellowship to go abroad was continuing frustration that I hadn't won a similar fellowship as an undergraduate. It was an unpleasant source of motivation, but the success led to many good things.</p>

  <p>Motivations that survive failures are the most valuable ones, as it's easier to sustain motivation than it is to resurrect it or find new sources. Unsustainable motivations also lead to burnout, which costs time and well-being. Sustainability varies from person to person, but internal motivations (i.e., the ones from within you) are typically more reliable than external ones.</p>

  <h3>No One Follows Advice About Failure Perfectly</h3>

  <p>It might be enough to try.</p>
