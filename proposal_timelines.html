  <p><strong>I created these pages to help students understand typically unwritten customs and procedures in academia.</strong> You're welcome to <a href="index.html">contact me</a> if you have questions about them.</p>

  <h1>Getting Started</h1>

  <p>The <strong><a href="thoughts_on_the_advice.html">Guide to the Advice</a></strong> contains suggestions for which of these pages to read and a brief history of this part of my website.</p>

  <p>The <strong><a href="teaching_faq.html">Guide for Interacting With Faculty</a></strong> is for students (especially first-year undergraduates and international students) who want to learn about expectations that university faculty have for them.</p>

  <h1>Writing and Publishing</h1>

  <p>The <strong><a href="scholarly_writing.html">Guide for Scholarly Writing</a></strong> ("Writing Guide") is for students who are writing manuscripts for assignments or for publication.</p>

  <p>The <strong><a href="citations_and_references.html">Guide for Citations and References</a></strong> is for students who are new to using citations and references, or need to refresh their memory.</p>

  <p>The <strong><a href="scholarly_publishing.html">Guide for Research Conferences</a></strong> ("Conference Guide" or "Publishing Guide") is for students who want to share their work with the research community.</p>

  <h1>My Lab and Research</h1>

  <p>The <strong><a href="advising_faq.html">Guide for Joining My Lab</a></strong> is for prospective students and visitors who are interested in doing research with me. It also contains some general guidance on graduate school in computer science and information science.</p>

  <p>The <strong><a href="lab_resources.html">Guide for Working in HLT Lab</a></strong> ("Working Guide") is for current lab members.</p>

  <p>The <strong><a href="student_research.html">Guide for Student Research</a></strong> ("Research Guide") is for students getting started in research. It contains information on strategies, expectations, and common obstacles.</p>

  <h1>Academia as a Career</h1>

  <p>The <strong><a href="tt_job_guide.html">Guide for the Tenure-Track Job Market in Computer/Information Sciences</a></strong> is for people (students and others) who want to apply for faculty positions.</p>

  <p>The <strong><a href="professorspeak.html">Guide to Professorspeak</a></strong> is a glossary of terms for new faculty and others who are curious about the jargon faculty use.</p>

  <h1>Autobiographical</h1>

  <p><strong><a href="academic_journey.html">My Academic Journey</a></strong> is a brief chronicle of my experiences in academia as a student or a career seeker at nine different universities.</p>

  <p><strong><a href="failure.html">Thoughts on Failure</a></strong> is a personal narrative about my biggest failures, with some advice from experience. Students who set challenging goals for themselves may find the contents of this page particularly relatable.</p>

  <p><strong><a href="competition.html">Thoughts on Competition</a></strong> is a personal narrative about competing for scholarships, awards, and other opportunities that I encourage my students to apply for.</p>

  <p><strong><a href="photography_thoughts.html">Thoughts on Photography</a></strong> describes my approach to taking the pictures that appear throughout these pages.</p>

  <h1>Quick Replies</h1>

  <p><a href="need_help.html">Need Help?</a> is a page I sometimes send as a reply to prospective research advisees who need help formulating their questions. I encourage other faculty to reply with a page like this when necessary, rather than ignoring prospectives' emails.</p>

  <p><a href="emailing_a_professor.html">Emailing a Professor: How to do it Well</a> is a page I sometimes send as a reply to students who will benefit from tips on professional email etiquette. I wrote it so that other faculty can use it too.</p>

  <p><a href="absence_from_class.html">Absence From Class</a> is a page I sometimes send as a reply to students when they tell me they will be absent from class.</p>

  <p><a href="reference_procedure.html">Reference Letter Procedure</a> is a page I sometimes send to students when I agree to write them reference letters, explaining what they need to send me.</p>

  <p><a href="enrollment_assistance.html">Enrollment Assistance</a> is a page I sometimes send to students who ask for help to add my courses.</p>

  <p><a href="for_teaching_assistants.html">For Teaching Assistants</a> is a page with instructions for teaching assistants joining my classes.</p>
