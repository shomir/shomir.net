<h1>Read This First</h1>

<p>I created this guide to help students understand how to publish their research in computer science and information science venues. <strong>This guide focuses on conference submissions</strong>, since conferences are typically the preimer publication venues in computer science and information science ("CS/IS" below for brevity). Toward the end, I include some information on how journals and workshops differ from conferences.</p>

<p>Important preliminary notes:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>My <a href="scholarly_writing">Guide for Scholarly Writing</a> and <a href="citations_and_references.html">Guide for Citations and References</a> are important companions to this guide. You should read them too.</strong></li>
  <li>Typically, the first time you're a lead author on a paper submission will be the hardest. The upside is that most of the knowledge you gain is transferable to other venues and papers, so that future submissions will be easier.</li>
  <li>I've organized this guide into steps for the publication process. I recommend reading the complete guide once and then checking in with it at the beginning of each stage.</li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, if you're not a member of my lab and you find this guide useful then please email me (see <a href="https://shomir.net">"Contacting Me" instructions</a>) or let me know on <a href="https://twitter.com/ShomirWilson">Twitter</a>.</p>

<h1>Before You Write</h1>

<h3>Finding the Right Conference</h3>

<p>You'll want to find a conference that's both the right fit for your work and has a submission deadline that is compatible with when your work will be ready. I recommend signing up for your research community's email lists long before you plan to submit a manuscript. This will help you to become aware of the conferences in your field and what time of the year their deadlines tend to be.

  <p>Many conferences are held on an annual basis, but some are held every other year or every few years. Looking at the proceedings from recent years is helpful to determine whether your research will fit in.</p>

  <p>Talking with your advisor is also a helpful part of choosing right venue. They will know if a conference is reputable (i.e., it's a worthwhile place to publish) and if it has unwritten themes or quirks to be aware of. If your advisor haven't published in a particular conference before, they may be able to help you evaluate it by looking at the list of organizers or recent proceedings.</p>

<h3>Do You Have Enough Material for a Paper?</h3>

<p>There's no simple way to determine this, but you can ask yourself questions like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Does your work have results, and do you have interesting observations about the meaning of the results?</li>
  <li>Does your work represent new knowledge about something?</li>
  <li>Placed next to prior related work, does yours contrast with it in a novel way?</li>
  <li>Have you created a resource for the research community that you're ready to share?</li>
</ul>

<p>Some "yes" answers to the above questions are a good sign, although they're neither necessary nor sufficient. Again, your advisor can help you decide.</p>

<h3>Reading the Call for Papers</h3>

<p>A <strong>call for papers</strong> (sometimes <em>CFP</em>) is an announcement issued by a conference with information on how to submit a paper. If you're planning to submit to a conference, you should keep its CFP bookmarked and check in on it often in case it changes. A CFP contains lots of useful information, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Important dates, and in particular, when submissions are due</li>
  <li>A list of topics the conference focuses upon</li>
  <li>Your options for a submission type (e.g., short or long papers)</li>
  <li>Required templates for preparing your manuscript</li>
  <li>Requirements for anonymity in the manuscript</li>
  <li>Other rules you must follow for a successful submission</li>
  <li>A link to a page where you upload your submission</li>
  <li>Whether the conference is archival (i.e., whether the proceedings are formally published)</li>
  <li>Whom to contact if you have questions</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes a conference issues an updated CFP (e.g., a "second call for papers") with new information such as deadline extensions.</p>

<p>You can find the CFP for a conference on the conference's website. Third-party CFP aggregators such as <a href="http://www.wikicfp.com/">WikiCFP</a> exist, but there is no guarantee that they are accurate or up-to-date. It's best to rely upon the conference's own website instead.</p>

<h1>Assembling the Submission</h1>

<h3>First Steps</h3>

<p>Some things you should do as soon as you decide to make a submission:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create an empty manuscript using the template in the CFP: This is easy, in the sense that it requires relatively little thought (compared to writing). Importantly, it makes it as easy as possible for you to begin writing or to drop in figures when they are ready. If you're using an online editor, share the project with your co-authors.</li>
  <li>Register on the submission site: Getting this out of the way early saves you from technical problems later. Submission sites occasionally malfunction, especially close to deadlines for busy conferences.</li>
  <li>Choose submission tracks and/or topics: Once you're logged into the submission site, look at the thematic tracks and topics. Choose the best options with help from your advisor. Good selections will guide your paper toward the reviewers that are most receptive to your work.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Naming the Manuscript's Project or File</h3>

  <p>Immediately after you create the manuscript from the template, rename the project (e.g., if using Overleaf) or the word processing file (e.g., if using Microsoft Word). I prefer that my advisees use the convention "[conference abbreviation] [year] - [first author's first name]". For example, a name like "EMNLP 2015 - Alan" helps me distinguish between my students' manuscripts. It will also help you stay organized if you are involved with more submissions in the future.</p>

  <p>You should keep a copy of the original template around to refer to it, but <strong>you should immediately customize (as above) the name for the project or word processing file that contains your work.</strong> This allows you to quickly distinguish between the template and your own work. Occasionally, confusing names lead to mistakes with disasterous results (i.e., deleted work).</p>

<h3>Writing Well and Avoiding Plagiarism</h3>

<p>If you didn't already, check out <a href="scholarly_writing.html">these</a> <a href="citations_and_references.html">guides</a>.</p>

<h3>Preparing Supplementary Materials</h3>

<p>A conference may ask that you submit supplementary materials, such as your dataset or source code, alongside a manuscript. You should plan on doing this if at all possible. Prepare documentation to accompany the supplementary materials. It should explain what they are to an audience that has only skimmed your paper. It should be well-written, but the format typically can be as simple as a text file.</p>

<p>If the dataset or source code is too large to upload, submit an illustrative subset of it instead and explain in the documentation.</p>

<h3>Determining Authorship and Author Order</h3>

<p>The author list should contain all people who made substantial intellecutal contributions to the paper. These contributions can include hypothesis formulation, software development, examination of results, writing, and research guidance. Sometimes people who make minor contributions (e.g., provided useful feedback once in a conversation or an email) are listed in the acknowledgements.</p>

<p>Conventions on author order vary. A common CS/IS convention is to list students first, in order by significance of contribution, and then to list faculty afterward. Typically the last faculty member is the first student author's advisor or the leader of the overall project. There are exceptions to these rules, though; sometimes all faculty (or all authors) are listed in alphabetical order. Sometimes a faculty member comes first if they contributed more than the students.</p>

<h3>Anonymity for Peer Review</h3>

<p>Many conferences use <em>peer review</em> to select papers: this means that other researchers review your paper to determine whether it merits publication. To avoid personal biases or conflicts of interest, most conferences use <em>double-blind review</em>: the authors don't know the identities of the reviewers, and the reviewers don't know the identities of the authors. Occasionally a conference may use <em>single-blind review</em>: the authors don't know the identities of the reviewers, but the reviewers know the identities of the authors. The CFP will specify the review procedure and whether you need to anonymize your submission.</p>

<h3>Tell Your Co-Authors When You've Completed the Submission</h3>

<p>Once you've submitted the manuscript, the submission site will send you a confirmation email. Forward the email to your co-authors, and attach a copy of the manuscript to it. This serves as an important confirmation to your co-authors that you completed the process.</p>

<h1>After Submission</h1>

<h3>Keep All Your Co-Authors Informed About Publication Progress</h3>
<p>If you are the corresponding author for a submitted manuscript (i.e., the person who communicates with the publication venue), promptly forward to your co-authors copies of submission confirmations, peer reviews, submission outcomes, and other official emails. These notices will help your co-authors to understand what is happening to the manuscript and to plan for their obligations.</p>

<h3>Participating in an Author Response Period</h3>

<p>Some conferences allow authors of submissions to read and respond to the reviewers' comments prior to a final decision being made. Carefully follow the instructions from the conference for the author response period. Typically, you are called upon to respond to reviewers' questions and to correct factual misunderstandings. <strong>You should not disgaree with reviewers' opinions or argue with them</strong>; such responses will not sway them, and you risk alienating other reviewers or the conference organizers.</p>

<p>I always recommend a "light touch" for author responses: be helpful and cordial, but <em>be brief</em>. Typical reviewers must read author responses for several manuscripts. A short response maximizes the likelihood that your reviewers will read all of it. Long responses rarely sway reviewers.</p>

<p>It's also customary to use the author response to thank reviewers for their feedback.</p>

<h3>If the Manuscript is Accepted</h3>

<p>Congratulations! Talk with your advisor about what changes to make prior to submitting the final version of the manuscript. The final version is sometimes called the "camera-ready" version for historical reasons. You're not strictly required to make any changes, but you should use the reviewers' feedback to improve the paper.</p>

<p>Remember to de-anonymize the manuscript if necessary. Also, if your research was supported by a grant, the grant number and the funding agency should appear in the acknowledgements. Your advisor can provide the appropriate information.</p>

<h3>If the Manuscript is Rejected</h3>

<p>Don't take it personally. Rejection is the most common outcome for submissions to competitive conferences, sometimes by a factor of four or more. Good papers are sometimes rejected simply because a conference doesn't have room to accommodate them.</p>

<p>When revising a rejected paper for submission elsewhere, it's helpful to make a spreadsheet listing reviewers' criticisms and changes you will make to improve the paper. Share this with your co-authors, and they can provide feedback on the changes you propose. A spreadsheet like this also helps co-authors divide up the work.</p>

<p>As a graduate student, my first three first-author submissions were all rejected.</p>

<p>As a postdoc, one of my publications was rejected twice before it was both (1) accepted by a conference and (2) a finalist for the accepting conference's best paper award.</p>

<h1>Miscellany</h1>

<h3>How Are Journals Different From Conferences?</h3>

<p>In many disciplines, journal papers are more important than conference papers. CS/IS is unusual: conference papers are often seen as more important than journal papers. Still, journal papers play an important role. They accept longer papers than conferences, permitting authors to document longer trajectories of work. One approach to a writing journal article is to integrate results from a conference paper (or multiple conference papers) with additional, unpublished results.</p>

<p>Journals are more likely to be single-blind than conferences, which tend to be double-blind.</p>

<p>Journal articles tend to take longer to publish. More than a year (or two) may pass between submission and publication. Submissions will sometimes go through multiple rounds of peer reviews and author revisions before the journal decides the manuscript is acceptable.</p>

<p>PhD students should aim to submit one or two journal papers before graduating.</p>

<h3>How Are Workshops Different From Conferences?</h3>

<p>Compared to conferences, workshops are more receptive to manuscripts that describe work in progress or preliminary results. They tend to be smaller events than conferences, with a greater emphasis on providing feedback to presenters and discussion amongst attendees.</p>

<p>Major conferences sometimes have workshops attached to them, i.e., the workshops use the same registration process, location, and other infrastructure as the main conference. Alternatively, sometimes workshops are independent events.</p>

<p>If you have a paper accepted to a conference that has workshops, you should browse the workshop list for opportunities to submit more of your work. Often the workshop submission deadlines are after the main conference's acceptance notification date.</p>

<p>Workshops are less likely to be archival than conferences or journals. When one isn't archival, you can use the opportunity to gather feedback on the ideas in a manuscript prior to submitting it to a conference. If the archival status is unclear, ask the organizers.</p>
