    <p><em>This guide is part of my <a href="advice_for_students.html">Advice for Students</a>.</em></p>

<h1>Read This First</h1>

<p>I created this guide to help students understand the unwritten rules and procedures for publishing their research. <strong>This guide focuses on conference submissions</strong>, since conferences are typically the preimer publication venues in computer science and information science ("CS/IS" below for brevity). Toward the end, I include some information on how journals and workshops differ from conferences.</p>

<p>Important preliminary notes:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>My <a href="scholarly_writing">Guide for Scholarly Writing</a> is an important companion to this guide. You should read it too.</strong></li>
  <li>Typically, the first time you lead a paper submission will be the hardest. The upside is that most of the knowledge you gain is transferable to other venues and papers, so that that every subsequent submission will be easier.</li>
  <li>I've organized this guide into steps for the publication process. I recommend checking in with this guide at the beginning of each stage.</li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, if you're not a member of my lab and you find this guide useful then please email me (see <a href="https://shomir.net">"Contacting Me" instructions</a>) or let me know on <a href="https://twitter.com/ShomirWilson">Twitter</a>.</p>

<h1>Before You Write</h1>

<h3>Finding the Right Conference</h3>

<p>You'll want to find a conference that's both the right fit for your work and has a submission deadline that is compatible with your work timeline. It's helpful to sign up for your research community's email lists long before you plan to submit a manuscript. This will help you to become aware of the conferences in your field and what time of the year their deadlines tend to be.

  <p>I recommend that students in my lab sign up for email lists run by <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/">ACL</a>, <a href="https://www.aaai.org/">AAAI</a>, <a href="https://www.acm.org/">ACM</a>, and <a href="https://www.usenix.org/">USENIX</a>. Some of these organizations will let you customize the announcements you receive to avoid an email deluge. Also, organizations like these that charge membership fees often will let you sign up for their email list for free by creating an account on their website.</p>

  <p>Many conferences are held on an annual basis, but some are held every other year or every few years. Looking at the proceedings from recent years is helpful to determine whether your research will fit in.</p>

  <p>Talking with your advisor is also a helpful part of choosing right venue. They will know if a conference is reputable (i.e., it's a worthwhile place to publish) and if it has unwritten themes or quirks to be aware of. If your advisor haven't published in a particular conference before, they may be able to help you evaluate it by looking at the list of organizers or recent proceedings.</p>

<h3>Do I Have Enough for a Paper?</h3>

<p>There's no simple way to determine this, but you can ask yourself questions like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Does my work have results, and do I have potentially interesting observations about the meaning of the results?</li>
  <li>Does my work represent new knowledge about something?</li>
  <li>Placed next to prior related work, does mine contrast with it in a novel way?</li>
  <li>Have I created a resource for the research community that I'm ready to share?</li>
</ul>

<p>Some "yes" answers to the above questions are a good sign, although they're neither necessary nor sufficient. Again, your advisor can help you decide.</p>

<h3>Reading the Call for Papers</h3>

<p>A <strong>call for papers</strong> (sometimes <em>CFP</em>) is an announcement issued by a conference with information on how to submit a paper. If you're planning to submit to a conference, you should keep its CFP bookmarked and check in on it often in case it changes. A CFP contains lots of useful information, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Important dates, and in particular, when submissions are due</li>
  <li>A list of topics the conference focuses upon</li>
  <li>Your options for a submission type (e.g., short or long papers)</li>
  <li>Required templates for preparing your manuscript</li>
  <li>Requirements for anonymity in the manuscript</li>
  <li>Other rules you must follow for a successful submission</li>
  <li>A link to a page where you upload your submission</li>
  <li>Whether the conference is archival (i.e., whether the proceedings are formally published)</li>
  <li>Whom to contact if you have questions</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes a conference issues an updated CFP (e.g., a "second call for papers") with new information such as deadline extensions.</p>

<p>Third-party CFP aggregators such as <a href="http://www.wikicfp.com/">WikiCFP</a> exist, but there is no guarantee that they are accurate or up-to-date. It's best to rely upon the CFP on the conference's own website instead.</p>

<h1>Assembling the Submission</h1>

<h3>First Steps</h3>

<p>Some things you should do as soon as you decide to make a submission:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create an empty manuscript using the template in the CFP: This is easy, in the sense that it requires relatively little thought (compared to writing). Importantly, it makes it as easy as possible for you to write or to drop in figures when you are ready. If you're using an online editor, share the project with your co-authors.</li>
  <li>Register on the submission site: Getting this out of the way early saves you from technical problems later. Submission sites occasionally malfunction, especially close to deadlines for busy conferences.</li>
  <li>Choose submission tracks and/or topics: Once you're logged into the submission site, look at the thematic tracks and topics. Choose the best options with help from your advisor. Good selections will guide your paper toward the reviewers that are most receptive to your work.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Naming the Manuscript Project or File</h3>

  <p>As soon as you create the manuscript from the template, rename the project (e.g., if using Overleaf) or word processing file (e.g., if using Microsoft Word). I prefer that my advisees use the convention "[conference abbreviation] [year] - [first author's first name]". For example, a name like "EMNLP 2015 - Alan" helps me distinguish between submissions that I'm helping students with. It will also help you stay organized if you are involved with more submissions in the future.</p>

  <p>You should keep a copy of the original template around to refer to it, but <strong>you should immediately customize (as above) the name for the project or word processing file that contains your work.</strong> This allows you to quickly distinguish between the template and your own work. Occasionally, confusing names lead to mistakes with disasterous results (i.e., deleted work).</p>

<h3>Avoiding Plagiarism</h3>

<h3>Preparing Supplementary Materials</h3>

<h3>Authorship Order</h3>

<h3>Anonymizing the Manuscript</h3>

<h1>Miscellany</h1>

<h3>About the Pictures</h3>

<p>I added them to break up the text; all of them are mine. I am a photographer in my spare time.</p>
