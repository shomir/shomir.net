<h1>Sharing My Narrative Statement for Tenure and Promotion to Associate Professor</h1>

<h2>Read This First</h2>

<p>I am sharing a lightly edited version of my narrative statement for the benefit of junior faculty. I received tenure and promotion to associate professor during my university's 2023-2024 application cycle.</p> 
  
  <p>My application dossier contained itemized lists of accomplishments (prepared using our university's software for reporting faculty work), my CV, and a narrative statement. </p>
  
<p>I provide these companion notes and the statement as-is with no guarantees. In addition
to reading materials like these, I recommend speaking with colleagues who can provide advice
for your individual circumstances. Tenure committees also may share their views on what
constitutes a strong narrative, and any advice from them should be taken seriously.Below is a version of my narrative statement that I've lightly edited for public release. Important notes for interpreting it follow below it.</p>

<blockquote><p>Lorem Ipsum.</p>

<p>More text.</p></blockquote>

<!--<li>You did not follow the instructions on my website for contacting me</li> -->
<li>You asked a question that I answered in the <a href="advising_faq.html">Guide for Joining My Lab</a></li>
<li>You did not follow the instructions for contacting me (also in the <a href="advising_faq.html">Guide for Joining My Lab</a>)</li>
<li>You are interested in an internship, but the opening does not exist (again, see <a href="advising_faq.html">the Guide</a>)</li>
<li>You did not show an awareness of my research, or it was limited to broad keywords</li>
<!-- <li>You contacted me about an old affiliation that I no longer have</li> -->
<!-- <li>You applied for a visiting position that does not exist</li> -->
<li>You appeared to use a generic email to contact several faculty at once</li>
<!-- <li>You appeared to believe that I directly accept applications to a degree program</li> -->
</ol>

<p>Many faculty members ignore emails with these issues. I decided that ignoring emails like yours would be mean, so I created this page to send as a reply. I hope you are not offended that I sent it to you.</p>

<p>You should check out the <a href="advising_faq.html">Guide for Joining My Lab</a> for information on how to join my lab. You might also check out the <a href="teaching_faq.html">Guide for Interacting With Faculty</a> for advice on emailing faculty. If you haven't already browsed my <a href="research.html">research</a> and <a href="publications.html">publications</a> pages to learn about my research, you should do that too.</p>

<p>After reading those materials, if you sense a good match between our interests, you are welcome to follow the instructions in the Guide for Joining My Lab to contact me again. Otherwise, there's no need to reply to the email I sent you.</p>

<p>Enjoy your day!</p>
