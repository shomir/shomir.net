<h1>Read This Part First</h1>
<p>Good writing means a lot to me. I created this guide for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>To share my writing philosophy with my students</li>
<li>To help students avoid common mistakes that I find in drafts</li>
</ol>
<p>However, this is not a comprehensive guide to scholarly writing. For a comprehensive guide, I suggest Strunk's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Style-William-Strunk-Jr/dp/194564401X">Elements of Style</a> or Hacker's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Writers-Reference-2016-MLA-Update/dp/1319083536">A Writer's Reference</a> (oddly expensive new--get it used). I keep copies of both of these in my office. If you are one of my advisees, you are welcome to borrow them anytime.</p>

<p>The intended audience for this guide is students whom I work with on publications, although I've written it in language to make it shareable more broadly. I may ask students in my classes to read it too. Class students should keep in mind that the advice about advisor feedback will not be applicable for their assignments.</p>

<p>For students I work with on a manuscript, I recommend reading this guide before sharing your progress, so that you can find and correct any problems in your writing.</p>

<p>Finally, I've written this guide in informal language to make it more engaging. As such, it does not always conform to the advice it conveys.</p>

<h1>Principles to Follow</h1>

<h3>Make Your Writing Approachable</h3>
<p>Frequently ask yourself how much your audience will understand your manuscript if they know only the basics of your field. If there are gaps in knowledge between those basics and your work, fill them in. Write accessibly, avoiding complex vocabulary and long sentences unless they are strictly necessary. Your goal never should be to impress the reader with the level of sophistication of your writing. In scholarly writing, an efficient, elegant style is more effective than a showy, virtuoso style.<p>

<h3>Write Intentionally</h3>
<p>Be intentional with your writing decisions: <strong>every detail of your writing should have a reason behind it</strong>. This applies to the biggest decisions (e.g., the order of sections), the smallest decisions (e.g., why each individual character appears in the manuscript), and everything in between. Although mistakes are inevitable in drafts, carelessness as a source for mistakes is avoidable.</p>

<h3>Copyedit Before Sharing for Feedback</h3>
<p>This means carefully reading what you wrote to correct all the errors you can find in spelling, grammar, punctuation, style, and other aspects of writing. If you show someone a draft that you did not copyedit, they will be uncertain which errors you will correct and which errors you do not notice. Also, a copyedited draft is easier to read, and it shows respect for the reader's time.</p>

<h3>Talk Yourself Through Difficult Patches of Writing</h3>
<p>If you get stuck trying to find a way to write something, imagine speaking about it in a conversation with a colleague. Transcribe what you would say, and then edit it until it meets the requirements. Many times while meeting with students I've guided them through this process, and almost inevitably they find the words or the sentences that they needed.</p>

<h3>Never Think You've Reached an Apex</h3>
<p>Recognize that your writing style should never stop improving. I also continue to improve.</p>

<h1>Specific Practices</h1>

<h3>Be Consistent</h3>
<p>Your manuscript should reflect consistency in capitalization, punctuation, abbreviations, formatting, and other stylistic aspects of writing. For example, you are welcome to decide whether to use the serial ("Oxford") comma, to leave one or two spaces after sentence-ending periods, to use English or American spellings, or to hyphenate certain collocations (e.g., "attention-based models" or "attention based models"), but for each of these decisions the entire document should reflect one choice.</p>

<h3>Define Jargon</h3>
<p>If your work introduces a new term or uses an existing term in an unusually specific way, tell the reader as early as possible what it means. If you must use jargon before fully defining it, provide a brief parenthetical clarification.</p>

<h3>Be Intentional With Capitalization</h3>
<p>Capitalization rules are complex and exceed the scope of this guide. However, as a simplifying principle, observe that (1) all words in a title should begin with a capital letter, excluding exceptions like short words in the middle; and (2) all words in a sentence should begin with a lowercase letter, excluding exceptions like the first word and any titles that appear in the sentence.</p>

<h3>Use Parallelism</h3>
<p>Use parallelism, especially in lists, captions, and headings. Sibling statements should be consistent in grammar, capitalization, and style. For example, consider the following captions for a figure.
<ol>
<li>F-scores for Models A and B.</li>
<li>An error analysis for models A and B shows divergent behavior</li>
<li>Error analysis for Models A and B, showing divergent behavior.</li>
</ol>
<p>#1 and #2 are not parallel. They differ on grammatical structure (#1 is merely a noun phrase while #2 is a full sentence), capitalization ("Models" versus "models"), and ending punctuation (a period versus none). #1 and #3, however, are properly parallel.</p>

<h3>Use Legible Font Sizes in Figures</h3>
<p>After placing a figure into the manuscript, if it contains a font size that is substantially smaller than the font size of the main body of the paper, it may be difficult for some readers to read. Increase the font size, redesigning the figure if necessary.</p>

<h3>Use an Accessible Color Scheme</h3>
<p>Some readers are colorblind. There are <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=colorblind+color+schemes&oq=colorblind+color+scheme&aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0l2.2951j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">guides</a> for selecting a color scheme that is attractive to both colorblind and non-colorblind people.</p>

<h3>Avoid Informal Language</h3>
<p>Some common offenders are contractions (e.g., "it's", "can't", "shouldn't"), "and so on", "etc.", and "okay". Many figures of speech are too informal for scholarly writing; in general, avoid using phrases that require metaphorical interpretation.</p>

<h3>Avoid Hedging Words</h3>
<p>These include "rather", "somewhat", and "arguably", among others. If you are tempted to use one of these words, find a more direct way to express your claim.</p>

<h3>Treat "Research" Properly</h3>
<p>Note that the plural of "research", when referring to research projects, is "research", not "researches". Non-native English speakers sometimes struggle with this.</p>

<h3>Avoid Invoking Trendiness</h3>
<p>Avoid using "in recent years", "nowadays", "recently", and other similar phrases. The implied trendiness will not age well. "Nowadays" is particularly egregious and informal, but all those phrases and other similar ones should be avoided.</p>

<h3>Use Granularity-Related Phrases Properly</h3>
<p>"Coarse-grained" means less specificity. "Fine-grained" means greater specificity. "More granular" implies more coarse-grained rather than more fine-grained.</p>

<h3>Avoid Aspirational Predictions</h3>
<p>Avoid "we wish", "we hope", and similar aspirational hedging. When strictly necessary, "we aim" or "we intend" are preferable instead.</p>

<h3>Cite and Reference Properly</h3>
<p>Direct quotations from other works (i.e., long sequences of words copied from somewhere else) should be identified with quote marks or (for longer excerpts) indented margins. A paraphrased passage should not receive quote marks or indented margins, but it should end with a citation.</p>
<p>Citations and references should be consistently formatted. Remember the difference between a citation and a reference: a citation indicates that ideas in your manuscript originally appeared elsewhere, and a reference is an entry in a list at the end of your manuscript that provides detailed information about a source. Each citation should pair with a reference, and the inclusion of each reference should be justified by at least one citation.</p>
<p>The parenthetical part of a citation (i.e., the part with parentheses or brackets) should not assume a grammatical role in a sentence. Consider these examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wilson et al. (2016) demonstrate a procedure...</li>
<li>(Wilson et al. 2016) demonstrate a procedure...</li>
</ol>

<p>#1 is correct, and #2 is not. If the difference is unclear, imagine leaving the parenthetical part out: does the sentence still make sense, and does it still serve its intended purpose? For a correct citation, the answer to both of those questions should be yes.</p>

<h1>Writing With Your Advisor's Help</h1>

<h3>Start Early</h3>
<p>Give your advisor as much time as possible to edit your drafts, so they can provide high-quality feedback. Agree to a schedule for drafts and revisions, and stick to it.</p>

<h3>Follow Your Advisor's Advice, Or Have Solid Reasons Not To</h3>
<p>Do not show your advisor a revision of a manuscript that silently disregards any of their prior feedback, no matter how small or large. If you do this, they will think that you do not value their feedback, and they may provide you with less in the future. You should reject advice if you are certain it is wrong, but you should make sure your advisor is aware that you rejected it and of your reasons.</p>
<p>When you send your advisor a revised draft, it's appropriate to tell them specifically what has changed, so they can focus their attention.</p>

<h3>Learn from Feedback</h3>
<p>Look at the changes your advisor suggests, and assimilate them into your scholarly writing style. If you do this, in future manuscripts your advisor will be able to give more attention to your ideas rather than your writing style.</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous Questions</h1>

<h3>How much does writing well matter?</h3>

<p>"I'm great at {programming, analyzing results, finding statistical significance, arguing with people, etc.}, and I wrote well enough to get to this point in my studies. Why do I need to write particularly well?"</p>

<p>Your writing skills set a ceiling for how your scholarly work will be judged. Great ideas that are communicated poorly tend to be less successful than modest ideas that are communicated well. Writing that is awkward or careless interferes with a reader's understanding of content, but writing that is clean, intentional, and elegant lets the content reach its full value.</p>

<p>In my career, I often observe that writing well has benefits. It increases the likelihood of manuscripts being accepted for publication and grant proposals being approved. It also encourages people to work together on projects, and it makes collaboration on manuscripts more straightforward and less time-consuming.</p>

<h3>How do I get better at writing?</h3>

<p>Practice often, by finding frequent opportunities to write. When you receive feedback on your writing, consider the reasons behind each correction and comment. Find ways to encourage yourself to be consistent and attentive to details. Read multiple genera of writing (e.g., news, nonfiction, fiction), and reflect on the differences between them. Identify authors that you like, and think about what they do well.</p>
