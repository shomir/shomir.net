<p>In middle school, a group of students decided to refer to me as a "broad-African booty scratcher". The epithet persisted for over a year.</p>

<p>In middle school, a student in my grade asked: "You're Indian, right?"</p>

<p>I said yes.</p>

<p>He made an "ooh-ooh-ooh" sound by clapping his hand repeatedly over his open mouth, producing a stereotypical Native American war cry.</p>

<p>In middle school, a student yelled at me: "Go back to Mexico!"</p>

<p>On a different occasion, a student said I was an illegal immigrant and laughed.</p>

<p>In high school, I briefly had a classmate whose family was from Pakistan. He was the only other person of South Asian ancestry in my classes, and some of my peers immediately assumed we were friends. I sensed our teacher thought the same. We got along fine, but we didn't have many opportunities to talk. A year later he moved to a different high school.</p>

<p>In high school, while attending a debate tournament held at a university, I saw a young Indian man walking across campus. I stared at him, marveling at how much he looked like me compared to everyone else I had ever met. He noticed my stare and said hello as he passed.</p>

<p>A high school teacher asked if I was Indian. I explained that I was born in the USA, but one of my parents was from India. He asked: "What if your karma eats your dogma?"</p>

<hr class="gray-thick"/>

<p>In elementary school, teachers and peers asked me where I was from. When I answered "Ohio", they seemed puzzled. I assumed I had answered the question incorrectly, and I began answering "India" instead. People seemed more satisfied. I continued using that answer through most of elementary school and middle school.</p>

<p>When I was a young child, at a reunion for the American side of my family, the topic of my Indian heritage came up. I had said nothing, but an elderly relative turned to me and said emphatically: "You may not think you have a lot in common with us, but you do." She looked at me for a long time, apparently wanting the message to sink in. I had thought I shared a lot in common with my American relatives; I barely knew my Indian relatives. I tried to smile, but I felt embarrassed and confused.</p>

<p>As a child, while riding my bicycle around my neighborhood, I passed by a yard where two siblings were playing. I overheard the girl, a few years older than me, explain to her younger brother that I was one of the "bad people" and he should never play with "people who look like that".</p>

<p>Several months later, during winter, my family's car got stuck in the snow on our street. Another car pulled over. I saw the same siblings look at me from the back seat, expressionless as their father stepped out and helped us dig out our car.</p>

<p>One summer during graduate school, my girlfriend and I were on a road trip in Louisiana. We stopped at a public park along the Mississippi River and walked across the park to the levee. Along the way, a man saw us and asked me: "Are you a terrorist?"</p>

<p>Reflexively, I said "No."</p>

<p>"Okay," he replied.</p>

<p>My girlfriend and I kept walking.</p>

<p>When I was a postdoc, during a conversation among two faculty and me, one said aside to the other that they weren't going to hire any of "those Indian masters students". They shared a laugh.</p>

<p>When I was a graduate student, I met with a professor who read my name aloud and remarked: "With a first name like that, you must be. . . Israeli?" On several occasions people have told me that my name means "protector" in Hebrew.</p>

<hr class="gray-thick"/>

<p>In college, shortly after 9/11, an anonymous online account sent me a message describing me as a "Hindu-ass freak". (I am not Hindu.)</p>

<p>Briefly in college I had a goatee. A few months after 9/11, I overheard one of my friends tell another that I "really [did] look like a terrorist". Soon afterward I shaved the goatee.</p>

<p>Later in college, I was waiting for an elevator in the library. A man walked up to me, looked at me with intense curiosity, and asked: "Oh dear, tell me, where are you from?"</p>

<p>"Ohio", I said bluntly.</p>

<p>"Oh," he replied, deflated. "I guess it doesn't matter where any of us are from." He walked away.</p>

<p>Early in graduate school, I went for an evening walk in a nearby shopping mall. It was almost Christmas, and I noticed that the mall had a Black Santa. I suddenly realized that most of the mall patrons were Black. I thought: <em>I'm one of the few white people here.</em></p>

But then I wondered: <em>Am I white?</em>

<p>When I was traveling to interview for a faculty position, a woman staffing the hotel reception desk asked me: "Why is your last name 'Wilson'?"</p>

<p>I replied, "Why not?"</p>

<p>"Good answer," she said. She smiled and returned to typing on her computer. Later, she continued: "Let me guess: American father."</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied.</p>

<p>"Aha!" She seemed satisfied.</p>

<p>"My mother is an American, too."</p>

<p>She looked up, puzzled. "Okay, I'm not going to touch that one."</p>

<p>As a professor, I attended a reception at a large international conference. A graduate student asked me: "Where are you from?"</p>

<p>"The US," I said.</p>

<p>She persisted: "No, where are you <em>really</em> from?"</p>

<hr class="gray-thick"/>

<p>As I walked down a street in a major city, I passed a pair of Black men talking. One of them paused the conversation to nod to me and say: "What's up, Black brother?" </p>

<p>I said "Hi!" and kept walking. He misidentified me, but I felt honored.</p>

<hr class="gray-thick"/>

<p>A professor who grew up in India learned that I had grown up in the US. He told me I was "not Indian".</p>

<hr class="gray-thick"/>

<p>A contractor visited our house (belonging to my wife and me) to give us a quote to repair its chimney. He asked how many languages I speak.</p>

<p>I said maybe one and a half.</p>

<p>He ventured to guess that I wasn't born in the US. I said I <em>was</em> born in the US.</p>

<p>He said I looked like I was from somewhere else, like the Middle East, and he mentioned the nearby university's large population of foreign students.</p>

<p>Late one evening, when my wife and I checked in at a hotel, the clerk scolded me for not greeting him in a language other than English that he assumed that he and I shared. I didn't know what it was. He then said I looked nervous, and he asked why. I told him I was tired and wanted my room. He repeated that I looked nervous, and emphasized at length that I was "safe [there]". </p>

<p>While I walked through a crowded train station in Turin, Italy, a police officer stopped me and asked to see my ID. Three other officers silently spread out to encircle around us. I handed over my passport, and the officer looked at it for a few minutes before handing it back to me and signaling wordlessly that I was free to go. I spent two hours in that station, but I saw no one else confronted. That was the only time during that trip that I saw an assembly of four police officers confronting a single person.</p>

<p>An employee at a supermarket asked me, "Hey, are you from Brazil?" I said no. He said that I looked just like a man he knew from Brazil, and that it was a place where people danced like monkeys and juggled fruit.</p>

<hr class="gray-thick"/>

<p>At an international conference, a professor who was an Indian citizen and based at a university in the USA spoke to me about problems with her residency status. She assumed that I experienced the same obstacles. I clarified that I'm an American citizen.</p>
