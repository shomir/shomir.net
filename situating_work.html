  <h1>Read This First</h1>

  <p><em>This guide is part of my <a href="advice_for_students.html">Advice for Students</a>.</em></p>

  <p>I've written this guide with a perspective that I call <strong>citation positive</strong>, focusing upon the value that citations add to a writer's work. Citations contribute to the meaning and significance of a manuscript, and a writer should feel positive motivation to use them. However, this positivity shouldn't be mistaken for optionality. It's important to remember that <strong>the absence or abuse of citations is plagiarism</strong>, which can have serious consequences. </p>

  <p>This guide is intended students who are new to using citations and references, or need to refresh their memory. Students entering college or graduate school in the USA are sometimes unfamiliar with these concepts, especially international students, but they absolutely must know this information. Your work will be subject to the same standards (which Penn State refers to as <a href="https://undergrad.psu.edu/aappm/G-9-academic-integrity.html">academic integrity</a>), regardless of whether you're aware of them.</p>

  <p>This guide covers the basic concepts of citations and references, rather than committing to a style guide that specifies how they should look. I've linked to some style guides as examples.</p>

  <p>Finally, if you find this guide useful then please email me (see <a href="https://shomir.net">"Contacting Me" instructions</a>) or let me know on <a href="https://twitter.com/shomirwilson">Twitter</a>.

  <h1>Citations and References Give Value to Your Work</h1>

  <p>It's rare for scholarly work to happen in isolation. Sometimes people produce stunning results <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan">by themselves</a>, but researchers tend to be more productive when they review existing work and then build upon it.</p>

  <p>How do you situate your work, demonstrating that you've (1) built upon others' work and (2) you haven't tried (perhaps vainly) to reinvent the wheel? By popular agreement, authors <strong>cite and reference</strong> when they borrow ideas from other people. Ethically, it's important to give credit to your sources. It also gives value to your manuscript, which becomes integrated with the literature on the topic you've chosen to write about. Ideally you want lots of integration, with citations to lots of relevant work. You want readers to see that you've thoroughly reviewed others' contributions to a topic, building a solid foundation for your own contributions.</p>

  <h1>Key Terms</h1>

  <p>Here are some key terms. I'll explain some of them in greater detail in the next section.</p>

  <p>A <strong>source</strong> is something that provides you with information. In academia often this is a scholarly paper, but it also might be a video, a popular news article, or an interview.</p>

  <p>A <strong>citation</strong> is a formal indication in your writing that you borrowed an idea from others' work. It appears near the borrowed idea, often at the beginning of it or just after it. It tends to be brief, consisting of just enough information to connect it with a reference, which appears elsewhere in the manuscript. A citation always connects with a reference in your manuscript.</p>

  <p>A <strong>reference</strong> is a detailed identification of a source that you borrowed ideas from. A reference only appears in your manuscript if at least one citation connects with it.</p>

  <p>(Be aware that citations and references are sometimes together referred to as simply "citations" or "references". For example, in this guide I sometimes refer to them collectively as "citations". However, both citations and references must appear in a scholarly paper. One is incomplete without the other.)</p>

  <p>A <strong>quote</strong> or <strong>quotation</strong> is text that you copy or transcribe verbatim (i.e., word-for-word) from a source. Writers use double quote marks or indented margins to distinguish quotations from their own original work. A quotation is incomplete without a citation to indicate where the text is originally from.</p>

  <p>A <strong>paraphrase</strong> is a restatement of others' ideas using your own words. It shouldnâ€™t be set apart with double quote marks or indented margins, but it's still incomplete without a citation.</p>

  <p>A <strong>style guide</strong> is a set of instructions for how to write well. <a href="https://style.mla.org/">The Modern Language Association's Handbook</a> is an example, and my <a href="scholarly_writing">Guide for Scholarly Writing</a> has some style guide content. Your instructor or a publication venue many point you to a style guide containing instructions for the required format for citations and references.</p>
