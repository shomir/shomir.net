<h1>Read This First</h1>

<p><strong>I wrote this guide to support members of my lab.</strong> Please read it when you join my lab and bookmark it for future reference.</p>

<!-- <p>This guide is a non-exhaustive list of resources that are useful for lab members. Some of them specifically belong to the lab, while others are widely available.</p> -->

<p>To increase the longevity of the text, I omit some details such as hyperlinks to resources with addresses that I expect to change. (Searching for them should work.) If you need to know more about an item or you're looking for something that isn't here, please ask me or another lab member about it. I am glad to connect my advisees with resources for their research and professional development.</p>

<p>Finally, if some part of this guide (or any of my <a href="advice_for_students.html">guides</a>) is out of date or incorrect, let me know.</p>

<h1>Guidance</h1>

<h3>Advice for Students</h3>

<p>My advisees should follow the instructions I provide in this guide and throughout <a href="advice_for_students.html">Advice for Students</a>. After you read them, bring me any questions. I'm also pleased to correct any mistakes you find.</p>

<p>Note the <a href="advising_faq.html">Guide for Joining My Lab</a> contains lots of information about my approach to advising, which is relevant even after you join the lab.</p>

<h3>Writing</h3>

<p>See my <a href="advice_for_students.html">Advice for Students</a> for several guides on writing manuscripts and submitting them to publication venues.</p>

<p>For PhD and MS students, the <a href="https://gwc.psu.edu/">Graduate Writing Center</a> is a good resource. Also, some students report that the free tier of <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/">Grammarly</a> is helpful.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a> is my preference for collaboratively preparing manuscripts for publication, but Microsoft Word is acceptable. I also recommend <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> for managing your reference lists. It works with both LaTeX/BibTeX and Word.</p>

<h3>Career Planning</h3>

<p>I welcome conversations with my advisees about career planning, regardless of whether you are certain or uncertain about you goals. If we can't fit a career conversation into a project meeting, a separate meeting is reasonable. I sometimes suggest one proactively if I sense a need, but you can request one if necessary.</p>

<p>IST's Career Solutions office also provides career advice as well as resources for finding internships and jobs.</p>

<h3>Statistics</h3>

<p>If you need someone to talk with about using statistics in research, Penn State's <a href="https://scc.stat.psu.edu/">Statistics Consulting Center</a> is useful.</p>

<h3>Applying for Things</h3>

<p>I am glad to provide feedback on my advisees' applications for scholarships and fellowships.</p>

<p>I am also glad to provide feedback on my advisees' resumes and CVs, though you should revise based upon feedback from IST's <a href="https://ist.psu.edu/current/careers">Career Solutions</a> before approaching me.</p>

<p>For letters of recommendation, see the entry in my <a href="teaching_faq.html#question_letter">Guide for Interacting With Faculty</a>.</p>

<h3>When Life Happens</h3>



<p>Penn State's <a href="https://studentaffairs.psu.edu/counseling">Counseling and Psychological Services</a> ("CAPS") is open to all Penn State students. There's no need to talk with me about using this resource, but if you would like my assistance, I can help you call or visit CAPS.</p>

<h1>Meetings and Collaboration</h1>


<a name="project_meetings"></a>
<h3>Project Meetings</h3>

<p>Here are some guidelines to make the most of our research meetings:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Send calendar invites promptly:</strong> Once we decide to schedule or reschedule a meeting, send the calendar invite as soon as possible and by the end of the day at the latest. I plan my days using my calendar, and missing items on it cause problems. If it's a videoconferencing meeting (e.g., using Zoom), send a combined calendar-and-videoconferencing invitation.</li>

<li><strong>Bring slides:</strong> Slides provide structure for our meetings, and they give us artifacts to point at and examine. They also record your research progress for your future reference.</li>

<li><strong>Mind the details:</strong> Before the meeting, proofread your slides and sanity check your results in them. At best, errors are distracting. At worst, they introduce misconceptions that take time to correct, or they mislead our research direction.</li>

<li><strong>Begin with a list of topics we should discuss:</strong> This helps to budget our time. </li>

<li><strong>After the list of topics, review the big picture:</strong> Remind me about the research questions you're currently working on and any conclusions from previous meeting. I may have had many meetings since we last met, and a review helps me understand your work. After the big picture, you can show new results.</li>

<li><strong>Use time carefully:</strong> Focus on what I need to know about your progress and what you need feedback on. Bring clear, straightforward questions that I can help with.</li>

<li><strong>Avoid showing raw output from computational tools:</strong> You should improve the readability of results by creating your own tables and figures. For example, poorly labeled data (e.g., "0" and "1" labels) or excessive digits after decimal points reduce my ability to quickly understand your work.</li>

<li><strong>Avoid scrolling:</strong> When people show me lots of scrolling on a screen, I get motion sickness.</li>

<li><strong>If you wish, record our conversation or keep notes:</strong> Some students record our meetings so that they can review my feedback later. I'm typically fine with being recorded, but ask first. Some students take written notes; we can pause the conversation at any time if you need to catch up. Other students use neither recordings nor notes. Find what works best for you.
</ul>

<h3>Presenting Your Work at a Lab Meeting</h3>

<p>Follow all applicable <a href="#project_meetings">guidelines for project meetings</a>, plus these additional guidelines:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Prepare your presentation for an audience that hasn't seen your work before.</strong> Some lab members may be entirely unfamiliar with your work. New PhD students and undergraduates at the meeting will not know some technical terms. If you're tempted to say something like "I'm sure we're all familiar with [a concept]", it's a good sign you shouldn't say that, and instead you should explain the concept.</li>
<li><strong>Practice your presentation.</strong> This should help you proofread your slides and calibrate your presentation length.</li>
<li><strong>Encourage audience participation throughout your presentation,</strong> not just at the beginning and end. Ask the audience for feedback on problems you're facing or questions you're wondering about. Ask for opinions on things that you think lab members may find interesting. If you talk for more than five minutes without audience participation, it's time to re-evaluate how you're presenting and get the audience talking again.</li>
<li><strong>Be prepared to present for two-thirds of your allocated time,</strong> i.e., 40 minutes out of an hour or 20 minutes out of a half hour. The rest should be time for setup, questions, and discussion.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Cancellations</h3>

<p>Personal health and well-being are more important than research. If you need to postpone work or cancel a meeting, let me know as early as possible. A few days' notice permits me (and potentially other lab members) to replan. The flu and similar contagious illnesses are a sufficient reason to cancel a meeting, or to teleconference from home if you feel able.</p>

<h3>Peer Collaboration</h3>

<p>Check with me before asking a lab member to commit substantial effort toward something they're not already working on (e.g., if you need significant help on data labeling, coding, analysis. etc.). I might be aware of time constraints or priorities that interfere.</p>

<p>If another lab member's behavior is interfering with your work, please bring it to my attention. I will speak with them and rearrange projects if necessary. The university's policies on discrimination and harassment apply to interactions between lab members at all times.</p>

<p>Remember that I make all decisions about lab membership and participation in lab research projects. My advisees are typically free to discuss their research with anyone, but to join the lab or to join one of our research projects, a person must talk with me first. Prospective advisees should follow the instructions in the <a href="advising_faq.html">Guide for Joining My Lab</a>.</p>

<a name="section_teamwork"></a>
<h1>Teamwork Resources</h1>

<h3>Email List</h3>

<p>All lab members should be subscribed to the lab listserv (address omitted here to reduce spam). I distribute announcements over this list.</p>

<h3>Slack</h3>

<p>We have a <a href="https://hltlab.slack.com">Slack workspace</a> that all lab members should join. Feel free to use it to organize projects, to ask for help, to share helpful resources, or to discuss news related to lab research. I may check in sometimes, but if you need my attention, please email me instead.</p>

<p>Although the Slack workspace is not an official university resource, I still expect lab members to follow the university's <a href="https://policy.psu.edu/policies/ad96">acceptable use policy for information resources</a>.</p>

<h3>Scheduling Meetings With 3+ Attendees</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.when2meet.com/">When2Meet</a> and <a href="https://doodle.com/">Doodle</a> are helpful for scheduling meetings with three or more attendees. I prefer When2Meet, but sometimes there is a reason to choose Doodle.</p>

<h3>Membership List and Members' Websites</h3>

<p>I maintain a lab membership list on our website, <a href="https://hltlab.org">hltlab.org</a>. Note that it may take me some time to update the list when memberships change. Contact me if you have a website that should be listed with your name. I encourage all of my advisees to provide a website to link to, even if it's a stub page that you will expand later or a LinkedIn profile.</p>

  <br/>

<a name="section_productivity"></a>
<h1>Productivity Assets</h1>

<h3>Personal Computing</h3>

<p>If you are one of my PhD students and you need a laptop, let me know. The lab can sometimes purchase laptops or lend you a spare one. You are welcome to travel with the laptop and use it for both personal and professional tasks, but it remains the property of the lab, and you must return it when you separate from the lab.</p>

<p>If you are developing an app for smartphones or tablets, the lab might be able to provide these devices. They also will remain the property of the lab. Note that it's generally not possible to provide service plans.</p>

<h3>Centralized Computing Resources</h3>

<p>Our lab has a CPU/GPU server named <strong>Nessie</strong> that all lab members are welcome to use. Nessie's specs are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>2x</strong> Intel Xeon Silver 4210R Processors, 10 Core, 20 Threads, 2.40Ghz, 13.75M Cache, 100W </li>
<li><strong>12x</strong> 32GB DDR4 2666MHz ECC REG Memory Modules </li>
<li>1TB M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD (OS) </li>
<li>3.84TB, SATA 6Gb/s, 3D, TLC 2.5", 7.0mm SSD </li>
<li><strong>2x</strong> NVIDIA TITAN RTX 24GB GDDR6</li>
<li>Titan RTX 3/4 Slot Bridge </li>
</ul>

<p>To get onto the authorization list for using Nessie, email the IST Helpdesk with me CC'd. Once authorized, to access Nessie, you must first be on IST's network or SSH into the college's gateway (ssh.ist.psu.edu) with your Penn State ID as credentials. After that, you can use your Penn State ID to SSH into nessie.ist.psu.edu. Contact IST's IT helpdesk if you encounter problems or need additional software installed on Nessie. <strong>Remember to back up your work elsewhere.</strong></p>

<p>To host web demos of research, our lab has a virtual server, administered as part of IST's computing cluster. Contact me for details.</p>

<p>Penn State's Institute for Computational Data Science has a freely available tier of access to their <a href="https://ics.psu.edu/about/ics-centers/">computing cluster</a>.</p>

<p>If these resources are insufficient for your work, let me know and we'll look for more. Purchasing computing time or a server are sometimes possibilities.</p>

<h3>Repository for Software and Data</h3>

<p>The lab has a <a href="https://git.psu.edu/hlt-lab">group on PSU GitLab</a>. I encourage lab members to create projects in the group for their work, to frequently push changes to the repository, and to document their projects so that they can be picked up by others.</p>

<!-- <p>Occasionally code and datasets may live elsewhere, if they are backed up frequently.</p> -->

  <br/>

  <center><em>Trees and seawater texture from Lobos Point, California.</em></center>
  <br/>

<h3>Physical Lab Space</h3>

<p>We have desks, chairs, and cabinets for lab members to use in a shared lab space. To gain access, ask me for details and then contact IST Facilities.</p>

<p>You are welcome to informally "claim" a desk, but please keep it clean (e.g., throw away trash) and keep it clear enough for other lab members to temporarily use when you are not present. Students are welcome to use any desks that are allocated to my lab. If you encounter a shortage of our desks, let me know and I will request more.</p>

<p>Remember that many people have access to the lab space. Take appropriate security precautions with your belongings.</p>

<p>For my guidelines on presence in the lab, see the entry on my advising style in the <a href="advising_faq.html#advising_style">Guide for Joining My Lab</a>.</p>

<h3>Books</h3>

<p>You can ask about borrowing any of the books on the bookshelf in my office, for research or for personal interest. If you're looking for a particular topic, ask and I might be able to help.</p>

<p>Penn State has a subscription to <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/home/">O'Reilly's ebook service</a>, which is useful for picking up new technical skills.</p>

<p>Penn State also has an excellent library, where I've borrowed books for both work and personal enrichment.</p>

<h3>Linguistic Data Consortium</h3>

<p>IST and CSE jointly hold a membership in the <a href="https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/">Linguistic Data Consortium</a> that allows us to download a limited number of corpora per year from their collection. Let me know if using this resource will help your work.</p>

    <br/>
    <img src = "images/faqs/newport_silo.jpg" alt="Fisheye view facing upward next a silo with the night sky, overlain with gentle ripples" style="max-width:100%; max-height:50vh; display:block; margin:auto"/>
    <center><em>Silo near Newport, Virginia; water rippling texture from Geysir, Iceland.</em></center>
    <br/>

<a name="section_miscellany"></a>
<h1>Miscellany</h1>

<h3>Publication Opportunities</h3>

<p>When you join the lab, I recommend that you sign up for email lists run by <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/">ACL</a>, <a href="https://www.acm.org/">ACM</a>, and <a href="https://www.usenix.org/">USENIX</a>. These email lists will help you to become aware of publication opportunities. You should be able to receive announcements for free (i.e., without paying for membership) by creating accounts on their websites, but let me know if this isn't possible.</p>

<p>I appreciate when my advisees take the initiative toward choosing where and when to submit manuscripts, though they should tell about those plans so that I can provide guidance.</p>

<a name="lab_branding"></a>
<h3>Lab Branding</h3>

<p>Our lab's name should be written as either "the Human Language Technologies Lab" or "HLT Lab". For the abbreviated version, note capitalization and the single space between "HLT" and "Lab".</p>

<p><a href="images/hlt_lab_with_url.png">This version of the HLT Lab logo</a> and <a href="images/PSU_IST_RGB_2C.png">this College of IST logo</a> should be included on posters about lab research and in slide decks for presentations to non-lab audiences about lab research. On posters, they should appear either flanking the title at the top or together at the bottom. In slide decks, they should appear together on the first slide and also on the last slide. As with all images on posters or slides, preserve the original aspect ratios (i.e., do not stretch images horizontally or vertically).</p>

<p>Logos from relevant collaborators and funding agencies also should be included in posters and slides, typically adjacent to our logos.</p>

<p>Lab members are welcome to include their affiliation with HLT Lab in their resumes, CVs, websites, or anything else that represents themselves. However, they should check with me before using the lab name or logo in ways that represent the lab as a whole.</p>

<h3>Posters</h3>

<p>Use a sample lab poster from <a href="https://git.psu.edu/hlt-lab/poster-samples">this GitLab project</a> as a template for your poster. Note that some of the samples are vertical and some are horizontal, and you may need to adjust the dimensions to match a venue's requirements.</p>

<p>Typically the best place to get posters printed is the Engineering Copy Center, though sometimes poster presentation events provide their own options worth considering.</p>

<p>If you're traveling with a poster that you will present, ask about borrowing my poster tube. It's designed for travel, with a reinforced cylinder and a shoulder strap.</p>

<h3>Reimbursement for Research Expenses or Official Travel</h3>

<p>Check with me prior to anything that will require reimbursement; we should agree on an estimate. IST's Finance Office can explain reimbursement procedures. If paying upfront isn't practical, let me know and we'll investigate alternatives.</p>


<h3>About the Pictures in This Guide</h3>

<p>I added them to break up the text; all of them are mine. I am a photographer in my spare time.</p>
