<p>The responsibilities that we delegate to computers are ever-increasing in richness and complexity. Necessarily, <em>how</em> we delegate tasks to our computing technology is changing as well. This change is happening with the aid of assistants, agents, and other models that shape sophisticated machine action as directed by human intent. My research in the areas of usable privacy, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence has supported this movement by seeking to answer questions such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users of websites and mobile apps face many challenges to their privacy. The stakes are high for users, who wish to avoid oversharing or misappropriation of their personal data. They are also high for providers of websites and mobile apps, which thrive only with public trust. By helping users to reflect on what they disclose online, is it possible to help them make privacy decisions that align with their professed preferences? Can crowdsourcing, natural language processing, and machine learning bridge the gap between companies' privacy practices and users' understanding of those practices?</li>
<li>Language technologies rely on the resources we give them, but their efficacy is limited by how well they exploit all the available channels of meaning. One frequently overlooked channel is <em>metalanguage</em>, which provides direct, salient information about language in written and spoken contexts. By learning how people refer to document entities, can computers annotate those entities with descriptive tags, context-sensitive summaries, and other valuable information? Can computers acquire information about language by recognizing how people write or speak about language?</li>
<li>Artificial intelligence has endeavored to solve many domain-specific problems, but <em>brittleness</em>&mdash;the tendency of an AI system to break when facing the unexpected&mdash;remains widespread. Is it possible for AI systems to mimic the introspective resilience that humans exhibit when faced with anomalies or the unanticipated? To what extent can metacognition contribute to the robustness of an AI system?</li>
</ul>
<p>These threads are unified by a theme that I have named <em>information introspection</em>: solving problems with metareasoning (the ability to consider and modify oneâ€™s reasoning) sourced from computing technologies and from their users. As a career goal, I will add the analysis of embedded meta-level information to the toolbox of techniques that computer science and related fields use to solve problems. By drawing together topics that have had limited contact, I will enrich innovation in each of them.</p>
