  <p><em>Students typically don't need to know the information in this guide, but I keep it in my <a href="advice_for_students.html">Advice for Students</a>.</em></p>

  <h1>Read This First</h1>

<p><strong>I wrote this guide as a glossary for terms that a certain segment of university faculty tend to use: those who are US-based, research-intensive, tenure-track professors in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics">STEM</a> disciplines.</strong> It explains a mix of basic and advanced terms, but it's far from comprehensive. This guide may interest (1) new faculty, (2) students who overhear these terms and are curious about what's going on, and (3) people outside academia who are perennially mystified when talking to faculty members in their lives.</p>

<p>Research administration and finance are overrepresented in this guide because these faculty spend a lot of time on these topics and the jargon for these topics is especially cryptic. (Sympathy for the professor whose relatives assume they have a side gig as a <a href="#pi">private investigator</a>.) See my other guides for <a href="teaching_faq.html#professor_titles">what professors' job titles mean</a>, <a href="scholarly_publishing.html">how faculty talk about scholarly publishing</a>, and <a href="advising_faq.html">terms related to graduate school</a>.</p>

<p>This guide might be biased toward terms that I found especially cryptic or interesting when I began working as a professor. Also, remember that my discipline is computer and information science, and some terms may vary in other disciplines.</p>

  <!-- <p>This page shares some themes with my <a href="failure.html">Thoughts on Failure</a>.</p> -->

<h1>The Glossary</h1>

<p><strong> AAU:</strong> <a href="https://www.aau.edu/">Association of American Universities</a>. An invitation-only organization of US and Canadian universities, both public and private, with strong research missions. Membership is considered prestigious, but note that many universities with strong research missions aren't part of AAU. See also <a href="#r1">R1</a>.</p>

<p><strong> AAUP:</strong> <a href="https://www.aaup.org/">American Association of University Professors</a>. Unrelated to AAU, an organization of professors and other academics, with chapters at many US universities. AAUP advocates for academic freedom and _shared governance_. At some universities AAUP facilitates a labor union or advocates for unionization.</p>

<p><strong> academic unit:</strong> Typically an academic college, school, or department within a university.</p>

<p><strong> buy-out:</strong> When a professor uses grant money to pay their academic unit for an exemption from teaching a course. There are caveats:</strong> some funding sources don't permit buy-outs, and the department head or dean has to approve.</p>

<p><strong> CAREER Award:</strong> A prestigious NSF grant from its Faculty Early Career Development ("CAREER") program, which pre-tenure faculty in NSF-funded disciplines are encouraged to apply for.</p>

<p><strong> cluster hire:</strong> A faculty hire who is part of a coordinated group of hires across the university, as part of a strategic effort to boost expertise in a particular area of research. Cluster hires are typically expected to spend part of their time working with the cluster on projects.</p>

<p><strong> COA:</strong> Collaborators and Other Affiliations. Part of a grant proposal, a document listing a professor's collaborators and any affiliations they hold. This information is used to avoid selecting reviewers who would have a _conflict of interest_ with the success of the proposal.</p>

<p><strong> COI:</strong> Conflict Of Interest: A situation where a faculty member could improperly receive personal benefits from things they do in an official capacity. Universities have formal mechanisms for faculty to officially disclose these situations and avoid them.</p>

<p><strong> C&P:</strong> Current and Pending funding. Part of a grant proposal, a document that lists research funding that a professor currently has and other funding they've applied for.</p>

<p><strong> consulting:</strong> Being paid to perform work for an outside entity, typically a company. The compensation to a faculty member typically goes through the university, which takes a cut for _indirect costs_.</p>

<p><strong> courtesy appointment, courtesy affiliation:</strong> An affiliation with an academic unit that comes with limited responsibilities, granted for mutual benefit. For example, a professor may receive a courtesy appointment with a departmentÂ to collaborate more easily with its faculty or to gain access to its graduate students. In exchange, the department can count the faculty member's expertise in its portfolio.</p>

<p><strong> direct costs:</strong> Costs in the budget of a proposal that are specifically for the activities in the proposal. Contrast with _indirect costs_.</p>

<p><strong> endowed chair:</strong> A professorship that provides extra salary or extra research funds, as bestowed by a donor to the university.</p>

<p><strong> extension:</strong> Most often used as expected (e.g., a deadline extension), but occasionally used to refer to <strong>agricultural extension</strong>: farming-related education and services that a _land-grant_ university provides to the public.</p>

<p><strong> external:</strong> As used throughout this guide, a source of money from outside a university. It could be a government, a nonprofit group, a company, or another organization.</p>

<p><strong> facilities and administration ("F&A"):</strong> See _indirect costs_.</p>

<p><strong> graduate faculty:</strong> Faculty who are permitted to serve as advisors for graduate students' theses. Tenure-track faculty are almost inevitably graduate faculty, while faculty in other roles might be able to apply for the status. Having a PhD is a requirement.</p>

<p><strong> hard money:</strong> Salary that the university guarantees regardless of the faculty member's success with grants, contracts, consulting, or other sources of money. Tenure-track faculty members are typically "hard money" positions. Contrast with _soft money_.</p>

<p><strong> IRB:</strong> Institutional Review Board, a university office that provides ethical oversight for research activities that involve human subjects. Faculty or students who want to perform experiments on human subjects must seek IRB approval first. Informally, people sometimes say "an IRB" to refer to an application sent to IRB for an experiment protocol or the permission from IRB to perform an experiment.</p>

<p><strong> indirect costs:</strong> A fraction of the budget of a _proposal_ devoted to supporting the university's ability to host research, but not attached to the specific activities described in the proposal. Often indirect costs are a certain percentage of an external proposal's budget, specified as a single line item without details. Contrast with _direct costs_.</p>

<p><strong> invited talk:</strong> When someone is invited to give a talk about their research. Some invited talks are part of a seminar series, and some are one-off events. Sometimes an invited talk is secretly a _job talk_, but it's impolite to ask and it's safest to assume otherwise.</p>

<p><strong> job talk:</strong> A talk that a job candidate for a faculty position gives during their interview, to present their work.</p>

<p><strong> lab:</strong> The group of researchers and research support personnel that a faculty member (or multiple faculty members working together) supervises; alternatively, the space in the building where they work. Personnel may include graduate and undergraduate researchers, postdocs, lab managers, technicians, and others. Some faculty members use the term "lab" for their group, and some don't. Note that the term "lab" typically isn't regulated by universities, which means a faculty member can create a lab simply by naming it and referring to it.</p>

<p><strong> land-grant university:</strong> A university designated by a US state to receive public benefits from the _Morrill Acts of 1862 and 1890_. Historically, the designation meant focusing on agricultural and technical education, but modern land-grant universities often have a full array of different educational programs that include the liberal arts. The term has connotations of serving the public good and the needs of the state's population.</p>

<p><strong> liberal education:</strong> a style of education with an emphasis on breadth of knowledge, especially including the arts and humanities. "General education" requirements represent a basic liberal education. Note that "liberal" here differs from political uses of the term.</p>

<p><strong> limited submission:</strong> A competition for an external grant that limits the number of submissions it considers from each university. A university may have to run an internal competition to select among its possible submissions.</p>

<p><strong> no-cost extension:</strong> When a funding source gives a grant recipient more time than they originally requested to spend the money in the grant.</p>

<p><strong> normal school:</strong> An institution designed to train teachers. This term has become archaic, and it's most often used when describing universities' histories. Some US universities began as normal schools in the 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>

<p><strong> Office of Research</strong> and/or <strong>Office of Sponsored Programs:</strong> An office that helps faculty apply for _external_ funding. The office prepares budgets, checks proposals for compliance with rules, finds funding opportunities, and performs other related activities. Often an academic unit and the university's central administration have their own separate OoR/OSP, with different responsibilities.</p>

<p><strong> overhead:</strong> See _indirect costs_.</p>

<p><strong> prep:</strong> Time needed to prepare to teach a class session; when plural, the number of courses a faculty member must regularly prepare to teach.</p>

<p><strong> prime:</strong> Some multi-university grants are structured so that one university first receives all the money and then passes along some of it to the other participating universities; that one university is called <em>prime</em> for the grant.</p>

<a name="pi"></a>
<p><strong> principal investigator (PI), lead PI, co-PI:</strong> Terms for official leadership roles on grants. (They're technically different, but "PI" generically covers all of them.) These terms indicate that the funding agency recognizes a faculty member as a leader of a funded project and responsible for its activities. A grant may have one PI or several in a hierarchy.</p>

<p><strong> program officer, program manager, program director:</strong> Terms for people at funding agencies who have roles in deciding which grants get funded and following up with PIs about the status of their projects.

<p><strong> proposal:</strong> A formal request for money or resources to support scholarly activities. Proposals can be internal (i.e., to funding sources inside of the university) or external (to funding sources outside the university). Proposals typically contain a plan for work, a budget, and other (possibly many other) documents.</p>

<p><strong> PT:</strong> Promotion and Tenure: committees and procedures for two important aspects of tenure-track faculty advancement. Promotion is the progression from Assistant Professor to Associate Professor, and from Associate Professor to Full Professor. Tenure is the special form of job security that successful tenure-track faculty receive. At most universities, tenure and promotion to Associate Professor are expected to coincide, but there are exceptions.</p>

<a name="r1"></a>
<p><strong> R1:</strong> A designation for universities that have the highest level of research activity, according to the <a href="https://carnegieclassifications.iu.edu/">Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education</a>. Contrast with <strong>R2</strong> universities, which have some research but not as much as R1s. Wikipedia has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_research_universities_in_the_United_States">lists of both</a>.</p>

<p><strong> RFP:</strong> Request for Proposals: a formal document from a funding source that explains how to prepare and submit a proposal for a funding opportunity.</p>

<p><strong> RIF (Research Incentive Fund)</strong> or <strong>RIA (Research Incentive Account):</strong> At many universities, a small fraction of a grant's _indirect costs_ aren't consumed by the university, and instead they are routed to the _PI_'s control in a special fund with a name like this. The university places relatively few restrictions on how this money is spent: for example, it can be used to pay students, to support professional travel, or to buy equipment. These expenses can be for an existing project or a new one.</p>

<p><strong> RPT:</strong> Reappointment, Promotion, and Tenure: _PT_ plus reappointment. Some universities have RPT, and others have PT. RPT universities structure pre-tenure faculty employment as a series of 1-3 year job contracts, and reappointment is the decision whether a pre-track faculty member receives the next contract. The expectations leading to reappointment are more forgiving than they are for tenure.</p>

<p><strong> sabbatical:</strong> A paid break from teaching and other obligations, granted to a faculty member after reaching tenure and then periodically again every several years. A sabbatical allows the professor to focus on scholarly activities that they typically don't have time for.

<p><strong> seed grant:</strong> A grant intended to jump-start scholarly activities (such as research) that will lead to a larger grant proposal. Universities sometimes use internal seed grants to help faculty generate preliminary research results to use toward external grants.</p>

<p><strong> service:</strong> A faculty member's activities to support their university, academic unit, scholarly community, or discipline in general. Service activities are distinct from teaching or research, and the three form the standard triad of responsibilities for tenure-track faculty.</p>

<p><strong> shared governance:</strong> Processes that allow faculty, staff, administrators, and sometimes others (e.g., students) to share decision-making for the university.</p>

<p><strong> small liberal arts college (SLAC):</strong> A small university where _liberal education_ is a priority. "Small" here is relative and poorly defined: SLACs vary in size from fewer than a hundred students to several thousand students. SLACs have a reputation for personalized attention to students' interests and high-quality teaching. _R1s_ are often contrasted with SLACS. (Personalized attention and high quality teaching exist at R1s too, but students often must be more proactive to obtain them.)

<p><strong> soft money:</strong> Salary that depends upon the faculty member's success with grants, contracts, consulting, or other sources of money, rather than a guarantee from the university. _Research-track_ faculty and postdocs often depend on soft money to stay employed. Contrast with _hard money_.</p>

<p><strong> sponsored research:</strong> Research conducted using funds from an _external_ source. Sponsorship may come from a government agency (e.g., the NSF or NIH), a company (e.g., Google), or another entity (e.g., the Sloan Foundation).</p>

<p><strong> startup:</strong> A fund that a starting faculty member receives from their academic unit to begin their lab and their research. During their first few years, they are expected to transition from startup-funded research to externally-sponsored research. (Note that faculty sometimes form startup companies, too. Those are different.)

<p><strong> solicitation:</strong> See RFP.</p>

<p><strong> subaward:</strong> Typically, when a faculty member receives grant money from another university (i.e., not the one they work for), which in turn received the grant money from a funding agency. Also see _prime_.</p>

<p><strong> submission window:</strong> A period of time when a funding agency accepts proposals. Faculty typically have to turn in their documents to their _Office of Research_ a few days before the window "closes", so that OoR can perform final checks and submit on their behalf.</p>

<p><strong> summer salary:</strong> Money that faculty receive for performing scholarly activities over the summer. Often, faculty have nine months of salary guaranteed by the university, and they have the option of finding salary sources for the remaining three months.</p>

<p><strong> teaching load:</strong> The number of classes that a faculty member is required to teach per semester or per academic year. Often, an _academic unit_ has a default teaching load that applies to all tenure-line faculty, but some may receive reduced loads because of research activity, _buy-outs_, job offer negotiations, leadership positions, or other obligations. Alternatively, a faculty member might teach a course "on overload" for extra money.</p>

<p><strong> teaching school:</strong> Often, a university where teaching is the dominant priority for tenure-track faculty. _SLACs_ are examples of teaching schools. Contrast with _R1s_, where research is at least as important as teaching, and _normal schools_, where students train to become teachers.</p>

<p><strong> Title IX ("Title 9"):</strong> A US law that prohibits sex-based discrimination. Title IX has a substantial impact on how universities deal with sexual harassment and how they allocate money to athletics programs.</p>

<p><strong> triage:</strong> When a grant proposal is returned from the funding agency without peer reviews. Triage is a signal to the submitter that the proposal requires radical changes to become competitive, or it should be scrapped altogether.</p>
