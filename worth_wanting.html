    <p><em>This page is intended for early pre-tenure faculty, but thematically it fits into the part of my website I (anachronistically) call <a href="advice_for_students.html">Advice for Students</a>.</em></p>

<h1>Read This First</h1>

<p>I wrote this guide for university faculty who are pre-tenure, work in a STEM-discipline, and have strong research expectations as part of their tenure case. It focuses on aspects of the job that I haven't seen discussed elsewhere or that I wanted to share my thoughts on. It is not comprehensive: I assume the reader is aware of the importance of the standard triad of research, teaching, and service and has access to detailed advice on them. Instead, I wanted to provide an experiential perspective, concerned with well-being, sustainable effort, and finding meaning in work.</p>

<p>My <a href="professorspeak.html">Guide to Professorspeak</a> complements this guide with relevant terminology, and <a href="proposal_case_studies.html">Inglorious Proposals</a> provides some experential narratives about seeking research funding. I recommend reading those too. If you don't have a tenure-stream faculty position but you'd like one, read my <a href="tt_job_guide.html">Guide for the Tenure-Track Job Market</a>.</p>

<p>Throughout this guide I offer examples from my work as pre-tenure faculty, spanning two universities and eight years, but there is more than one way to do many things I describe. My discipline is computer and information sciences, and some of the advice might be specific to that segment of faculty. Additionally, note this advice is unofficial and any errors are mine.</p>

<h1>Luck and Circumstance</h1>

<p>This guide is written with the assumption the reader works in a supportive academic unit. Things like ample startup funds, freedom to take moderate risks, a pleasant work environment, and a stable institutional outlook are not universal in academia. Even within an academic unit (e.g., a college or department), the experiences of individual faculty may vary.</p>

<p>This guide also assumes a baseline level of enthusiasm about being tenure-stream faculty. If you are unenthuisiastic or lukewarm about the job, your priorities may be different.</p>

<p>Finally, good fortune is a barrier to many deserving faculty candidates. There are not enough tenure-stream jobs for the people who want them, and positions at <a href="professorspeak.html#r1">R1</a> institutions are especially limited. I'm in a privileged position by being able to write this guide. Toward the end, I <a href="#acknowledgements">acknowledge</a> several people who helped me take advantage of opportunities when I encountered them.</p>

-->

<p>Prior to starting a tenure-stream faculty position, you may have had difficult experiences with earning a PhD, being a postdoc, or interviewing for faculty positions. You may feel impostor syndrome or a need to proactively prove that your past obstacles are behind you.</p>

<p>However, it's unlikely that your new colleagues know any obstacles you faced beyond those common to all new faculty. That's because they have no specific reason to know, and also because the expectations are roughly equal for those joining straight from their PhD, joining after a postdoc position (or several postdoc positions), or joining after an interlude in industry. Similarly, a new faculty member who spent several years on the academic job market and submitted hundreds of applications receives the same onboarding and expectations as someone who spent just one year on the market and submitted very few applications.</p>

<p>When I started my first faculty position (at University of Cincinnati), none of my colleagues knew that I needed two application cycles to get into any PhD programs, that I finished my PhD without a job offer and was unemployed for three months before becoming a postdoc, or that I had spent four years on the academic job market. When I started my second faculty position (at Penn State), none of my colleagues knew that I had spent a total of six years on the academic job market (i.e., two more beyond accepting my first position). At each new university I initially didn't talk about those things with colleagues, as I didn't want them to define people's impressions of me. However I gradually shared more, especially with students, as I realized my stories had pedagogical value. I share more about my path to a faculty position on <a href="academic_journey.html">another page</a>.</p>

<h2>Update Your Network</h2>

<p>It's possible that you haven't spoken in awhile with some friends and acquaintances who are (or soon will be) in academic positions. Contact them and let them know you're faculty now too. There's a chance they're looking for a collaborator for a project, or they will need one in the future. Don't rely on them seeing the news on social media, if you use that. Direct contact is a good way to spark conversations about mutual interests.</p>

<p>I've had successful grant proposals with a college roommate and a postdoc labmate. I've also submitted a grant proposal with a graduate school labmate.</p>

<h2>Make Friends</h2>

<p>Faculty friends who are also pre-tenure will be helpful for relating to, confiding in, and comparing experiences with. It's best if you have an assortment of them in a variety of places: within your department, within your university but not in your department, and at other universities. University-wide new faculty orientation is a rare opportunity to meet faculty from different parts of the university who are experiencing the same surge of newness that you are. As always, recognizing boundaries is appropriate (i.e., not everyone is looking for personal connections), but your chances of finding people to connect with personally are above average at early events.</p>
    
<p>Some academic environments constantly bombard new faculty with pressure to collaborate, and collaboration should be part of your work, but having relatable friends is part of your well-being. It's normal and beneficial to have social interactions with colleagues that aren't aimed at advancing your career.</p>

<p>None of the above is intended to detract from the importance of also having friends outside academia.</p>

<p>Among my longest-time faculty friends is someone I met during a research abroad program when we were graduate students, someone I met in the final minutes of a university-wide faculty orientation, and someone I met while standing in a very long line for food at a conference reception. We often talk about work, but we haven't collaborated.</p>

<h2>Declare a Lab</h2>

<p>Even without advisees, you can name your lab and start referring to it. If it seems presumptuous, think of it as a naming a small business you just started: the organization exists even when it's just you. Check that no one else at the university already claimed the name you want, and avoid "center" or "institute" in the name, as universities tend to regulate those terms.</p>

<p>Your lab name can serve as a side channel for communicating your expertise. In other words, it's a way to signal to people (e.g., students, colleagues, collaborators) what kinds of research you're interested in.</p>

<p>I had just one research advisee when I began referring to my group as the "Human Language Technologies Lab". I remember it seeming strange that the lab existed solely because I referred to it, but that's typically how academic labs exist: because faculty speak as if they do.</p>

<h2>Get Nice Things</h2>

<p>If you have a startup fund that includes computing equipment expenses, you might suffer from decision paralysis or a feeling of not deserving to get nice things. However, it's appropriate to get the computing equipment you want. If it's (1) within budget, (2) something that will help your productivity, and (3) not wasteful, go ahead and order it. Your university expects a lot from you, and those funds are intended to help you succeed.</p>

<p>Remember human factors. In particular, if your computing purchases include a keyboard and mouse, get the ones you've always wanted. You'll use them a lot.</p>

<p>If you observe senior faculty members using old or outdated computing equipment, don't let that discourage you from getting nicer things. Lack of interest or lack of time might be preventing them from upgrading.</p>

<p>Check if you can order equipment early enough prior to your start date that it will be waiting for you when you arrive.</p>

<p>I used my startup to purchase several items for my work: a desktop computer, a second display for the desktop, a laptop, and a wall-mounted display. My research advisees use the wall-mounted display to present slides during meetings. I also connect the display to a computer and a webcam so that students can gather with me to videoconference with remote collaborators. For my advisees, I bought a GPU server, monitors that double as docking stations for laptops, a mini-fridge, and a coffee machine. </p>

<h2>Explore Campus</h2>

<p>The abundance of free time that you may begin with will disappear, but before it does, you can familiarize yourself with campus. Features like museums, art installations, lounges, and libraries distinguish the built environment of a university campus from an office park with classrooms.</p>

<p>Find alternatives to your office for when you want a change of scenery or need a retreat to concentrate. At the University of Cincinnati, I sometimes decamped to the poetry room in the library. At Penn State, there are nice lounges in distant parts of campus where I can work in relative anonymity.</p>

<p>I feel good knowing that I share the institution with the museums and art galleries on campus: rather than decorations, they are artifacts of the university's core mission. The same applies to the performing arts at universities: it's an honor to have the faculty who teach or perform them as my colleagues.</p>

<h1>Getting Organized</h1>

<h2>Document Your Professional Activities</h2>

<p>Annual reviews, pre-tenure reviews, and the tenure application will expect you to list everything you've done. Even within a single year, remembering all your professional activities will be difficult. However, universities' record keeping systems for these reports tend to be cumbersome and don't encourage quick edits.</p>

<p>Have an easy way to keep track of all your professional activities.  A CV is only a start: some items that are appropriate in professional reviews might not be CV-suitable.</p>

<p>I use an <em>update cache</em>. It's a text document that contains to-do lists for additions or changes I need to make to each of my professional materials (CV, personal website, lab website, and faculty activity tracking website). The tasks are brief and informal, like "Add ArXiv paper about privacy law corpus", "add grad admissions committee", or "move [advisee's name] to alumni". Some duplication of tasks between the lists is inevitable and fine.</p>

<p>Instead of updating my professional materials every time I have something to add or change, I accumulate these tasks in the update cache. Periodically I <em>commit</em> the cache by processing all the tasks at once. The cache makes recording accomplishments quick and easy. Editing the update cache ten times and then editing my CV once takes far less time and effort than editing my CV ten separate times.</p>

<h2>Inventory Your Lab</h2>

<p>Your lab will start small, but later it will become difficult to mentally keep track of many aspects it, such as manuscript statuses and funding requests. Repeatedly searching for information when you forget it is inefficient.</p>

<p>Keep spreadsheets or other records for things about your lab that you want to remember quickly, and update them often. The following spreadsheets are important for how I run my lab:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Funding Applications</strong>: This contains one row for each grant proposal (internal or external), fellowship application, or any other formal request for resources. The columns include: Outcome, Date Submitted, Deadline, Type, Solicitation Name, Solicitation URL, Proposal Name, Collaborators, Outcome Date, and Notes.</li>
    <li><strong>Manuscript Submissions</strong>: This contains one row for each manuscript I'm an author on. The columns include: Result, Submitted Date, Deadline, Author Response Period, Author Notification Date, Lab Members Involved, Venue, CFP URL, Location, Event Dates, and Topic or Title, and Notes.</li>
    <li><strong>Lab Members</strong>: This contains one row for each of my research advisees. The columns include: Name, Email, Recentest Role, Access (a list of single-character flags that I use to indicate access to lab resources), Onboarding Date, Separation Date, Funding, Co-Advisor, Outcome, Project, and Notes. This spreadsheet helps me stay organized for onboarding and separation of each lab member.</li>
    <li><strong>Lab Computers</strong>: Each row represents a computer owned by my lab. The columns include: Year Purchased, Current User, Description, and Notes. It can be easy to lose track of all the computers your lab owns, especially those that you don't personally interact with often.</li>
    <li><strong>Lab Meeting Schedule</strong>: This is the only lab spreadsheet I share with my research advisees. Each row represents a lab meeting. The columns include: Time, Date, Location, Presenter(s), and Topic(s). At a <a href="lab_resources.html#lab_meetings"> typical lab meeting</a> one of my advisees presents their research, and this spreadsheet helps me efficiently announce and update the schedule.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recognize Your Day-to-Day Work</h2>

<p>Being busy for extended periods of time might not give you the sensation that you've made progress toward goals or accomplished many things. One way to reflect more accurately on your workload is to keep a log of your work activities and update it often. It doesn't have to be detailed or finely categorized, as long as it validates the time you've spent.</p>

<p>I keep a "work journal" that resembles a series of daily to-do lists except in the past tense. Whenever I send an email, teach a class, attend a meeting, edit a manuscript, or perform another similarly granular activity, I write a brief entry about it. I also mark tasks in a special way if I perform them after hours or on weekends. Reviewing the list at the end of the day, or over longer periods of time, provides reassurance that the passage of time had meaning and contributed to my goals.</p>

<h2>Make Teaching Notes for Your Future Self</h2>

<p>You get ideas, both big and small, on how to improve a course while you teach it. However, by the time you teach it again you're likely to forget much of what you wanted to change. One way to avoid forgetting is to write to-do course improvements notes in places that you will easily find the next time you teach the course.</p>

<p>Often just after I teach a class session with slides, I create a "post mortem" hidden slide at the beginning of the deck. I like to do this immediately after I dismiss the class, while I'm still standing at the podium. I write what went well and what I should change next time I prepare for the lecture. I also keep a "next time" to-do list for the overall course.</p>

<h1>Leading a Lab</h1>

<h2>Deconstruct Advising</h2>

<p>People often describe advising styles as "hands-on" or "hands-off". A more nuanced way to think about advising is to separately consider how you serve each of the different roles that an advisor can have in an advisee's development. These include (as identified in <a href="#more_reading">a book on mentoring</a>):</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>advisor</strong>: You guide students toward completing their degrees.</li>
    <li><strong>manager</strong>: You give students tasks to work on, resources to accomplish them, and feedback on how they're doing.</li>
    <li><strong>mentor</strong>: You guide students' professional development.</li>
    <li><strong>coach</strong>: You help students gain and improve specific skills.</li>
    <li><strong>sponsor</strong>: You promote students' achievements and help them to take advantage of opportunities. </strong></li>
</ul>

    <p>Among these roles, <em>advisor</em> is formally recognized by virtue of a student's degree program and <em>manager</em> is formally recognized through a research assistantship. The rest are informal but also important, and all are interrelated. Note some of roles can be served by multiple faculty, including those beyond a student's advisor and manager, but it's a sign of a good advising relationship if the advisor has some part in all five roles.</p>

<h2>You're a Manager Now</h2>

<p>In STEM research, many faculty delegate significant activities to their research assistants. Your success will depend in part on their productivity, which depends in turn on your ability to give them directions, resources, and a supportive work environment.</p>

<p>Recognize the need for manager skills when working with students. Don't dismiss management and related administrative activities as outside of your obligations. Although they are a step removed from what many people think of as the activity of <em>research</em>, they are essential for research to happen. Instead, devote time to finding ways to manage efficiently, and remember that good management sets the stage for many of the most satisfying interactions you will have with research advisees. Here, efficiency means spending less time on rote activities and more time on the things that you and your advisees most value.</p>

<p>Check <a href="#more_reading">More Reading</a> for learning resources on effective management.</p>

<p>Students working for you may have relatively little experience with workplace norms. Be patient with them, but note whether they improve when you coach them on professionalism. (If they don't, it might be a bad sign for their work.) Also keep in mind that they will model some of their workplace behaviors after yours.</p>

<h2>Use Email Wisely</h2>

<p>Email is useful for documenting informal agreements with research advisees. During a meeting at the beginning of a project, I sometimes write an email as I talk with the student, documenting our conversation about priorities and parameters. (I explain what I'm doing, so they don't think I'm just distracted.) I ask the student to read over it to confirm it matches our conversation, ask them if there's anything more I should include, and then send it just after the meeting ends.</p>
    
<p>"Schedule send" features of email clients are helpful. If you work over the weekend or late at night, you can schedule an email to go out early the next business day; this avoids giving the recipient work to do outside working hours, and it also elimintes the possibility the recipient will reply with more work for <em>you</em> outside working hours. Schedule send is also helpful to slow down the pace of email interactions that are time consuming.</p>
    
<p>When choosing between a long and carefully crafted email or an interactive conversation, often the conversation is more time-efficient and better for communicating tone.</p>

<h1>Hard Times</h1>

<h2>Navigate Mistreatment</h2>

<p>In a properly functioning academic unit, most of your coworkers should be friendly and helpful. One of my favorite aspects of working in a university is the people I meet and interact with on a regular basis. However, ancedotes about mistreatment are common in academia and bullying is a <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C39&q=academic+bullying+higher+education&btnG=&oq=academic+bullying">well-documented phenomenon</a>. The risks are unevenly distributed: pre-tenure faculty are especially vulnerable, and those who are part of underrepresented populations are even more so.</p>

<p>It is obligatory to report mistreatment and to expect relevant authorities to deal with it. However, beyond that is the reality that some forms of mistreatment are not actionable, and some remedies may seem infeasible. Because of power dynamics and risks (perceived or real), these difficult situations are likely to be more common than any one person in an academic unit is directly aware of.</p>

<p>You might be unable to prevent poor behavior toward you, but you can maximize your chances of shutting it down if an opportunity arises. Keep detailed notes on the behavior, how you reacted, and how people responded to your requests for help. These notes will reduce self-doubt later and help you to maintain perspective. Seek advice from a senior colleague, or if possible, an administrator whom you trust. Empathy is a good sign; if you don't sense it, seek advice elsewhere. It is reasonable to want to be listened to and to defend yourself.</p>

<h2>Keep Moving Forward</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_or_out">"Up or out"</a> (i.e., the requirement to advance in your job or find a new one) is practiced in relatively few professions, and it creates unique pressures. Problems that otherwise might be merely annoying assume greater significance. If you have limited experience with <a href="failure.html">failure</a> or <a href="competition.html">competition</a>, it may be difficult to distinguish temporary setbacks from truly devastating ones. Vague requirements for tenure make it more difficult to accurately self-assess.</p>

<p>Some universities publish statistics on tenure rates, or alternatively, faculty sometimes try to calculate them from anecdotal evidence. These statistics could be less useful than they seem. Make sure you're aware of all the possibilities before taking them seriously: for an external observer it might be impossible to distinguish instances of tenure denial from instances of departure just prior to a tenure verdict. It's further difficult to distinguish between voluntary and involuntary reasons for departure, and the distinction sometimes isn't meaningful.</p>

<p>In a small informal poll I conducted, two-thirds of tenured faculty (11 of 16) responded that at least once they had little or no confidence that they would receive tenure. Naturally, some of the pre-tenure faculty who have these difficult experiences don't get tenure, but it is revealing that most of the faculty that we would consider successful had a time when they seriously doubted their trajectory. Determining whether a setback is a tenure-scale problem might not be as important as finding ways to cope with uncertainty while continuing your work.</p>

<h2>Mind the FOMO</h2>

<p>Press releases, media mentions, intra-departmental announcements, and word of mouth provide an incomplete picture of your peers' activities, leaving out all the rejected manuscripts and grants. For some faculty, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out">fear of missing out</a> in the professional realm can be even more discouraging than in the social setting. Being successful as pretenure faculty means having some congratulation-worthy accompilshments, but remember that not everyone has them at the same time.</p>

<p>Faculty sometimes speak about certain special achievements, like <a href="professorspeak.html#career">NSF CAREER</a>, as "guaranteed" or "automatic" paths to tenure. The firmness in those statements is a figure of speech or an illusion. The special achievements are helpful, but they are likely to be correlated with other less luminous things that are more common and still amount to a reasonable tenure case.</p>

<p>During my eight pre-tenure years (i.e., two at Cincinnati and six at Penn State) I received one best paper award, from a workshop. I received no awards from my academic units or my universities.</p>

<h2>Remember It's a Job</h2>

<p>The pressures leading up to a tenure-stream position encourage faculty to think about it as a calling that transcends normal employment. What the job means is up to you&mdash;it might mean a little, or a lot&mdash;but remembering its status as a job is healthy and productive for navigating obstacles. All workplaces come with tradeoffs, but it is reasonable to expect a supportive environment for your work. When that expectation isn't met, you can try to improve the environment, speak with people who are better positioned to make changes, tolerate the status quo, or as a last resort, seek options elsewhere. It’s also possible to be satisfied with a workplace while searching for somewhere even better, or to be unsatisfied but continue to work at a place because it's best for personal constraints. The paucity of tenure-stream job openings makes moving difficult, but it's normal to be uncertain whether you will stay at your current institution for your full career.</p>

<p>I made a pre-tenure move from one major university to another, and people sometimes ask about my reasons. I prefer not to share them, but I can share that it took two search cycles during my first tenure-stream position to find a new position. The first of those cycles produced interviews but no offers. Also, my second tenure-stream university had rejected my applications twice before, both times several years prior to making the offer. When I negotiated the offer to move, I had the option to ask for credit (years) toward tenure, but I chose to reset my tenure clock to zero.</p>

<p>I think it's natural for some people to deeply want difficult things like an academic career, and an appropriate response isn't categorial rejection of strong wants. Instead, it's helpful to reflect on the tradeoffs you're willing to make and what the wanting does to you.</p>

<h1>Working Well</h1>

<h2>Quantity and Quality</h2>

<p>An excessive focus on publishing quantity is a common criticism of academia. Bibliometrics and vague expectations create pressure to publish as many manuscripts as possible, with a reduced focus on research fundamentals and the creation of knowledge. When I listen to people evaluating researchers' works, I observe a pattern: sheer quality receives moral praise but little attention, sheer quantity attracts attention but also criticism, and having both quality and quantity forgives their respective shortcomings.</p>

<p>Quality and quantity are often portrayed, even if implicitly, on a one-dimensional scale with tradeoffs between them. I've found it more meaningful think of them as a joint maximization problem and to examine the obstacles. Sometimes this leads to more work, but importantly, sometimes it doesn't. In some situations, there actually isn't a choice&mdash;e.g., the two papers can't be combined to make a stronger one, or there isn't enough time for a new project&mdash;and the tension between quality and quantity is an illusion.</p>

<h2>Find Your Teaching Strengths</h2>

<p>If your prior teaching experience is limited, teaching will be difficult at first. If you have no prior materials for a course, preparing it <em>de novo</em> will compound the difficulty. You may wonder whether teaching is easier for everyone else and whether you are doing something wrong.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that there exists variation among instructors' strengths: some approaches to teaching that come naturally to other faculty will be time-consuming for you, and some approaches that seem effortless for you will be difficult for others. It's OK if you're not equally good at all things teaching. The things you're good at may be difficult to notice, because you deftly do them. Once you realize what they are, though, you can use them for all they're worth.</p>

<p>Teaching math and proofs requires a lot of slow, arduous preparation for me. However, guiding a conversation on assigned reading is easy for me; typically I can get an interesting conversation going regardless of class size or composition. My impression is from students' and peers' reviews is that I'm unusually good at that, so I make conversations, audience participation, and small group discussions frequent in my teaching.</p>

<h2>Get Value From Proposal Writing</h2>

<p>Universities sometimes have <a href="professorspeak.html#seed_grant">seed grant</a> programs for their faculty. These tend to be much easier to apply for than major federal grants, and the benefits of applying extend beyond the possibility of funding. Writing a seed proposal collaboratively with another faculty member is a good way to get comfortable working with them and to lower the barrier to future collaborations with them. Even when working alone on these, they can be a good way to organize your thoughts on research problems, making it easier to apply for larger grants in the future regardless of seed proposal outcomes.</p>

<p>Smaller seed grants can be infeasible for supporting PhD students, and faculty sometimes question how they can get research started with so little money. Hourly-wage undergraduates or MS students can be cheaper to support. Note these alternatives incentivize you to develop skills for working with students who have no prior research experience and a limited skillset. These students can make meaningful contributions: by the end of my fifth year at Penn State, two undergraduates in my lab had first-authored conference papers.</p>

<p>Similarly, some private foundations and industry awards are relatively easy to apply for, and applying serves multiple purposes: idea incubation, collaboration development, and the possibility of funding. However, be aware of rules about simultaneous submission of grant proposals that overlap. Some funding sources are fine with simultaneity, and some aren't.</p>

<p>I used a proposal to a private foundation to develop ideas for my NSF CAREER proposal. The private foundation proposal was rejected, but the CAREER proposal was <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2237574&HistoricalAwards=false">awarded</a>. The two successful proposals I wrote about in <a href="proposal_case_studies.html">Inglorious Proposals</a> both began with collaborative seed grants.</p>

<h2>Get Press for Your Achievements</h2>

<p>Universities are typically motivated to promote their faculty. Many parties look favorably upon faculty achievements, including administrators, prospective students, donors, the reserach community, potential collaborators, and the general public. Determine whom at your university you should ask for press releases for grants, publications, awards, or other achievements. If it's unclear what counts as newsworthy, just ask. These press releases are sometimes useful for attracting new collaborators, and occasionally they lead to news pieces by external media, which count as <em>outreach</em>.</p>

<p>Press opportunities that you must pay for are unlikely to be worth the cost.</p>

<p>When being interviewed for a press release about research that an advisee led, encourage the press office to talk with the advisee too. You lose nothing by mentioning that a student is the technical lead on a project (assuming it's true), as their work is still part of your lab's portfolio. The novelty and thrill of being quoted is likely to be greater for the student than it is for you.</p>

<p>As a student, I assumed the faculty who appeared frequently in university press releases or magazines were the most successful ones. As a professor, I quickly realized that only a modest level of success was necessary, and what often distinguished those faculty was that they responded to requests from the press office and notified them of newsworthy items.</p>

<h2>Recognize Staff Are Your Colleagues</h2>

<p>Respecting staff goes beyond the recognition that they control your research funds, assign you classrooms to teach in, and maintain your computing resources. They are your colleagues, with their own professional trajectories, areas of expertise, and accomplishments. Recognizing their careers as significant is part of recognizing the significance of yours.</p>

<h2>Defend Lunch</h2>

<blockquote>
<em>The [compost] heap swiveled and lunged toward the Bursar. <br/>
The wizards backed away. <br/>
"It can't be intelligent, can it?" said the Bursar. <br/>
"All it's doing is moving around slowly and eating things," said the Dean. <br/>
"Put a pointy hat on it and it'd be a faculty member," said the Archchancellor.</em> <br/></em>
&#8212; From Terry Pratchett's "Reaper Man"
</blockquote>
    
<p>Your calendar will begin nearly empty, but within a year or two it will become crowded with meetings, seminars, teaching, and other events. It's easy to fall into a pattern of giving away all your time during the workday, including lunch. Breaks are important, but those for meals are especially important and (unlike Pratchett's professors) yours may require effort to preserve. Allocate time every day for lunch, even if it means postponing meetings until you have time for them elsewhere on your calendar. Once you cede lunchtime, even for an event that you expect to be once only, it may be difficult to reclaim.</p>

<p>However, avoid eating at a meeting if no one else has food. You may aggravate colleagues or students who have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misophonia">misophonia</a>.</p>

<h1>The Vocation</h1>
    
<h2>Your University's Identity and You</h2>

<p>A university subtly communicates its personality to its employees and to the general public. Confidence, underdog mentality, prestige, humility, tradition, innovation, permanence, or unconventionality might be parts of that personality in varying quantities. Also consider: a university's aspirations for its roles in the state, country, and world; its civic profile; its success in intercollegiate athletics; and how it juxtaposes teaching and research. When you meet with people external to your university, part of their impression of you may come from those messages. As an employee, it's easy to adopt those messages unaware.</p>

<p>When you attend internal and external events, take note how your university portrays itself. There may be times when you can use that portrayal to your advantage, and other times when pushing back against it is appropriate.</p>

<p>I've been a student, employee, or visiting researcher at nine different universities, and comparing and contrasting them is an engaging exercise. Internally to each university, I observe that its personality becomes a lens for evaluating new ideas or changes to established norms. Externally, especially at conferences, it's a factor (unfortunately) in how much attention people associated with a university receive.</p>

<h2>Freedom to Make Decisions</h2>

<p>The pressure to build a portfolio of activities for tenure and the vague requirements for tenure are frequent sources of stress. Tenure-stream faculty have abundant day-to-day freedom and limited supervision. The responsibility to do the right thing for your career in absence of a clearly defined path can seem daunting and oppressive. People sometimes refer to activities that aren't optimized for tenure as "distractions" from it, implying that pre-tenure faculty possess only a modest ability to judge what is good for themselves.</p>

<p>Remember that success on the scale of tenure doesn't come from a perfect record on everything you try, or a research agenda perfectly tuned for trendiness; instead, it comes from meeting expectations for an assortment of things done well. For your work to be sustainable (i.e., interesting and motivating for you), it's likely that a subset of your activities will be personally significant to you but not maximally responsive to tenure criteria.<p>

<p>I spent time mentoring undergraduate researchers when I could have performed other tasks with greater payoff, like submitting more grant proposals or working directly on research. However, mentoring undergraduate researchers is something I enjoy, which gives me energy toward other tasks. Similarly, writing <a href="advice_for_students.html">Advice for Students</a> is substantial work but it had little representation in my tenure portfolio. (During my fourth year at Penn State I discovered it had exceeded the word count of my dissertation.) However, I enjoy writing it and it helps my work in many ways. Additionally, I've received more gratitude for it than everything else I've written combined.</p>

    <h2>Professor in Progress</h2>

    <p>It can be intimidating to realize that your impact on students begins immediately when you start advising and teaching. There are no simulated advisees or simulated courses that you can train on before the real people. Instead, your earliest students will get a different experience than those just a few years later, as your skills improve.</p>

    <p>You should work with students in a way you can be proud of, but forgive yourself when you make mistakes. You owe it to the next advisee and the next course to approach them without baggage.</p>

    <p>Students may think of professors as unchanging over time, and prior to joining the faculty, you may have unknowingly thought of them that way too. It's easy for students to underestimate their reciprocal impact. This applies both on an individual basis (e.g., the mentees that you remember most vividly) and in aggregate (e.g., the dozens or hundreds of students you may speak with in an average semester). Recognize that the education you provide will always be a work in progress.</p>

    <p>Interacting with students is one of my favorite parts of being a professor, which I would have been surprised to learn as an introverted, self-conscious graduate student. I sometimes think about whether my difficult path to becoming faculty had a lasting impact on my personality, or whether finally arriving at a comfortable stage in my career revealed abilities I didn't know I had.</p>

    <h2>Bearing Witness</h2>

    <p>Being faculty is a commitment to bear witness to students' lives. Within classes, meetings, and casual conversations, you will learn about their personal joys and struggles, or observe indirect signs of them. At times you will be more than an observer: your role may provoke their gratitude, anger, reverence, sadness, wonder, frustration, or growth. Interacting with students will provoke many of those same things in you.</p>

    <p>You will witness students' successes, failures, and many in-between states, and the knowledge that you are watching will itself have an impact on students. With careful mentorship, you can try to make that impact positive regardless of whether they meet their goals. It's not always possible to provide a second try at something, but if a student senses your support, they are more likely to use future opportunities well.</p>

    <p>The vast majority of students will take one trip through college, which limits their perspective on it, while you will witness the process repeat many times. Similarly, nearly every student who completes a PhD will defend a thesis only once in their life, but graduate faculty participate in dozens of defenses over their career. The asymmetry is remarkable, and remembering it is part of being an empathetic professor.</p>

<h2>Privilege Worth Wanting</h2>

<p>Many have written about the perils and pressures of seeking an academic career. Graduate school forces students to make tough decisions about finances, geography, and personal relationships. Postdocs face enormous uncertainty in where they will live next and what their lives will be like. Tenure-stream faculty positions are some of the most difficult jobs to get in their respective STEM disciplines. For some candidates, positions at <a href="professorspeak.html#aau">AAU institutions</a> evoke levels of thirst and envy typically associated with show business or major-league sports. If you're in the target audience for this guide then you've already been through the gauntlet, and you may feel embarrassed or guilty about your good fortune. You were lucky when others around you weren't. Messages about academia in the news and in social media might make it seem inappropriate to admit that you enjoy your work.</p>
    
<p>However, the best response to the privilege of a tenure-stream job isn't denial or admission of guilt; instead, it's to recognize the privilege as a tool and use it well. Can you help undergraduates discover enthusiasm for your course topics? Can you make graduate school a more equitable and humane experience for your advisees? Are there ways to help non-tenure stream faculty feel at home in your academic unit? In general, are there things that you wanted on your career journey that you can help junior people find in theirs? If you're helping people, enthusiasm supports your work.</p>

<p>Remember being a professor gives you the capacity to inspire. The gulf between you now and the undergraduate you once were is a testament to your work, and stories about the obstacles you overcame are now assets. To the extent that you're comfortable, those stories can help students discover their own resilience.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>I thank several university faculty who helped me during my education and pre-faculty stages of my career:</p>

<p><a href="https://vtx.vt.edu/articles/2019/03/clahs-jack-dudley.html">Jack Dudley (1941-2019)</a>, Professor of Sociology and Director of University Honors at Virginia Tech, inspired me to pursue an academic career. I continue to borrow from his style of pedagogy that intensely valued students' intellectual abilities and contributions.</p>

<p>Don Perlis, Professor of Computer Science at the University of Maryland, was my PhD advisor. He gave me the freedom to explore my interests and was a uniquely patient listener with students.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.scotsman.com/news/obituary-jon-reid-oberlander-academic-professor-epistemics-co-founder-and-first-director-scottish-informatics-and-computer-science-alliance-1433199">Jon Oberlander (1962-2017)</a>, Professor of Epistemics at the University of Edinburgh, hosted me for a year-long visiting position. He was a model for compassion and intellectual curiosity as faculty in computing. He passed away soon after submitting a round of reference letters for my faculty applications, and I did not get to thank him properly or tell him the successful outcome of my search.</p>

<p>Alan Black, Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, hosted me for a year-long visiting position. I reflect on his willingness to entertain far-fetched ideas and his sense of humor.</p>

<p>Norman Sadeh, Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, was my postdoctoral supervisor for three years. I learned from him how to manage a lab, how to build collaborative teams, and how to run large projects. I also owe him for his unwavering support through my many years on the academic job market.</p>
