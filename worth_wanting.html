    <p><em>This page is intended for faculty, but thematically it fits into the part of my website I (anachronistically) call <a href="advice_for_students.html">Advice for Students</a>.</em></p>

<h1>Read This First</h1>

<p>I wrote this guide for pre-tenure faculty getting started in an academic unit with a strong research mission. It is not comprehensive, and instead it focuses on aspects of the job that I haven't seen discussed elsewhere or that I wanted to share my own thoughts on. In particular, I wanted to provide an experiential, humanist perspective, concerned with well-being, sustainable effort, and finding meaning in experiences.</p>

<p>I offer examples from my own work, but note that there is more than one way to do nearly everything I describe below. My area is computer and information sciences, and some of the advice might be specific to that segment of faculty. Additionally, note this advice is unofficial and any errors are mine.</p>

<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<h2>Recognize the Clean Start</h2>

<p>Prior to starting a tenure-stream faculty position, you may have had difficult experiences with earning a PhD, being a postdoc, or interviewing for faculty positions. You may feel impostor syndrome or a need to proactively prove that your past obstacles are behind you.</p>

<p>However, it's unlikely that your new colleagues know any obstacles you faced beyond those common to all new faculty. That's because they have no reason to know, and also because the expectations are roughly equal for those joining straight from their PhD, joining after a postdoc position (or several postdoc positions), or joining after an interlude in industry. Similarly, a new faculty member who spent several years on the academic job market and submitted hundreds of applications receives the same onboarding and expectations as someone who spent just one year on the market and submitted very few applications.</p>

<p>When I started my first faculty position (at University of Cincinnati), none of my colleagues knew that I needed two application cycles to get into any PhD programs, that I had finished my PhD without any job offers and was unemployed for three months before becoming a postdoc, or that I had spent four years on the academic job market. When I started my second faculty position (at Penn State), none of my colleagues knew that I had spent a total of six years on the academic job market (i.e., two more beyond the first position). At each new university I initially didn't talk about those things with colleagues, as I didn't want them to define people's impressions of me. However I gradually shared more, especially with students, as I realized my stories had pedagogical value. I share more about my path to a faculty position on <a href="academic_journey.html">another page</a>.</p>

<h2>Check In With People You Know in Academia</h2>

<p>It's possible that you haven't spoken in awhile with some friends and acquaintances who are (or soon will be) in academic positions. Contact them and let them know you're faculty now too. There's a chance they're looking for a collaborator for a project, or they will need one in the future. Don't rely on them seeing the news on social media, if you use that. Getting in contact is a good way to spark conversations about mutual interests.</p>

<p>I've had successful grant proposals with a college roommate and a postdoc labmate. I've also submitted a grant proposal with a graduate school labmate.</p>

<h2>Make Friends</h2>

<p>Having friends who are at the same career circumstances as you is beneficial. Faculty friends are helpful for relating to, confiding in, and comparing experiences with. It's best if you have an assortment of them in a variety of places: within your department, within your university but not in your college, and at other universities.</p>

<p>University-wide new faculty orientation is a rare opportunity to meet faculty from different parts of the university who are experiencing the same surge of newness that you are. Professional development workshops are sometimes helpful for that, too. As always, recognizing boundaries is appropriate (i.e., not everyone is looking to make friends), but your chances of finding people to connect with personally are above average at events like that.</p>

<p>Some academic environments constantly bombard new faculty with pressure to collaborate, and collaboration should be part of your work, but having relatable friends is part of your well-being. It's normal and beneficial to have social interactions that aren't aimed at advancing your career.</p>

<p>None of the above is intended to detract from the importance of also having friends outside academia.</p>

<p>Among my longest-time faculty friends is someone I met during a research abroad program as a graduate student, someone I met as we were leaving at the end of the university-wide new faculty orientation, and someone I met while standing in a very long line for food at a conference banquet. Some luck is always involved.</p>

<h2>Declaring a Lab</h2>

<p>Even without advisees, you can go ahead and name your lab and start referring to it. If it seems presumptuous, think of it as a naming a small business you just started: the organization exists even when it's just you. Check that no one else at the university already claimed the name you want, and avoid "center" or "institute" in the name, as universities tend to regulate those terms.</p>

<p>Remember that your lab name can serve as a side channel for communicating your expertise. In other words, it's a way to tell people (e.g., students, colleagues, collaborators) what kinds of research you're interested in.</p>

<p>I had just one research advisee when I began referring to my group as the "Human Language Technologies Lab". I remember it seeming odd and surreal that the lab existed solely because I referred to it, but that's typically how academic labs exist: because faculty speak as if they do.</p>

<h2>Spending Your Startup Fund</h2>

<p>If you have a startup fund that includes computing equipment expenses, you might suffer from decision paralysis or a feeling of not deserving to get nice things. However, it's appropriate to get the computing equipment you want. If it's (1) within budget, (2) something that will help your productivity, and (3) not wasteful, go ahead and order it. Your university expects a lot from you, and those funds are intended to help you succeed.</p>

<p>Remember human factors. In particular, get the keyboard and mouse or trackpad that you've always wanted. You'll use them a lot.</p>

<p>If you observe senior faculty members using old or outdated computing equipment, don't let that discourage you from getting nicer things. Lack of interest or lack of time might be preventing them from upgrading.</p>

<p>Check if you can order equipment early enough prior to your start date that it will be waiting for you when you arrive.</p>

<p>I used my startup to purchase several items for my work: a desktop computer, a second display for the desktop, a laptop, and a wall-mounted display. My research advisees use the wall-mounted display (a TV that masquerades as framed art when not in use) to present slides during meetings. I also connect the display to a computer and a webcam so that students can gather with me to videoconference with remote collaborators. For my advisees, I bought a GPU server, monitors that double as docking stations for laptops, a mini-fridge, and a coffee machine. </p>

<p>If your startup funds will expire soon and you're out of ideas for how to spend them effectively, check whether your research organizations offer lifetime memberships for a one-time lump sum. Eventually it could save you money, but regardless, it will save you the hassle of renewing periodically for the rest of your career. Additionally, some organizations have a requirement to be a member for a minimum number of years to be considered for fellow status, so you'll ensure that for your future self.</p>

<h1>Getting Organized</h1>

<h2>Keep Track of Your Professional Activities</h2>

<p>Annual reviews, pre-tenure reviews, and the tenure application will expect you to list everything you've done. Even within a single year, remembering all your professional activities will be difficult. However, the record keeping systems for these reports tend to be cumbersome and don't encourage quick edits.</p>

<p>Have an easy way to keep track of all your professional activities.  A CV is only a start: some items that are appropriate to include in reporting might not be CV-suitable.</p>

<p>For example I maintain an <em>update cache</em>. It's a text document that contains separate to-do lists for additions or changes I need to make to each of my professional materials (CV, personal website, lab website, and faculty activity tracking website). The tasks are brief and informal, like "Add ArXiv paper about privacy law corpus", "add grad admissions committee", or "move [advisee's name] to alumni". Some duplication of tasks between the lists is inevitable and fine.</p>

<p>Instead of updating my professional materials every time I have something to add or change, I accumulate these tasks in the update cache. Periodically I <em>commit</em> the cache by processing all the tasks at once. The cache makes recording accomplishments quick and easy. Editing the update cache ten times and then editing my CV once takes far less time and effort than editing my CV ten separate times.</p>

<h2>Keep Track of Your Lab</h2>

<p>Your lab will start small, but later it will become difficult to mentally keep track of many ongoing aspects it, such as manuscript statuses and funding requests. Repeatedly searching for information when you forget it is inefficient.</p>

<p>Keep spreadsheets or other records for things about your lab that you want to remember quickly, and update them often. The following spreadsheets are important for how I run my lab:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Funding Applications: This contains one row for each grant proposal (internal or external), fellowship application, or any other formal request for resources. The columns include: Outcome, Date Submitted, Deadline, Type, Solicitation Name, Solicitation URL, Proposal Name, Collaborators, Outcome Date, and Notes.</li>
    <li>Manuscript Submissions: This contains one row for each manuscript I'm an author on. The columns include: Result, Submitted Date, Deadline, Author Response Period, Author Notification Date, Lab Members Involved, Venue, CFP URL, Location, Event Dates, and Topic or Title, and Notes.</li>
    <li>Lab Members: This contains one row for each of my research advisees. The columns include: Name, Email, Recentest Role, Flags (a list of letters I use to indicate access to lab resources), Onboarding Date, Separation Date, Funding, Co-Advisor, Outcome, Project, and Notes. This spreadsheet helps me stay organized for onboarding and separation of each lab member.</li>
    <li>Lab Meeting Schedule: This is the only lab spreadsheet I share with my research advisees. Each row represents a lab meeting. The columns include: Time, Date, Location, Presenter(s), and Topic(s). At a typical lab meeting one of my advisees presents their research, and this spreadsheet helps me efficiently announce and update the schedule.</li>
    <li>Lab Computers: Each row represents a computer owned by my lab. The columns include: Year Purchased, Current User, Description, and Notes. It can be easy to lose track of all the computers your lab owns, especially those that you don't personally interact with often.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recognize Your Day-to-Day Work</h2>

<p>Being busy for extended periods of time might not give you the sensation that you've made progress toward goals or accomplished a significant number of things. One way to reflect more accurately on your workload is to keep a log of your work activities and update it often. It doesn't have to be detailed or finely categorized, as long as it validates the time you've spent.</p>

<p>I keep a "work journal" that resembles a series of daily to-do lists except in the past tense. Whenever I send an email, teach a class, attend a meeting, edit a manuscript, or perform another similarly granular activity, I write a brief entry about it. I also specially mark tasks if I perform them after hours or on weekends.</p>

<h2>Make Teaching Notes for Your Future Self</h2>

<p>You get ideas, both big and small, on how to improve a course while you teach it. However, by the time you teach it again you're likely to forget much of what you wanted to change. One way to avoid forgetting is to write to-do course improvements notes in places that you will easily find the next time you teach the course.</p>

<p>Often just after I teach a class session with slides, I create a "post mortem" hidden slide at the beginning of the deck. I typically do this immediately after I dismiss the class, while I'm still standing at the podium. I write what went well (this is reassuring) and what I should change next time I prepare for the lecture. I also keep a "next time" to-do list for the overall course.</p>

<h1>Working</h1>

<h2>Difficult Colleagues</h2>

<p>In a properly functioning academic unit, most of your coworkers will be collegial and helpful. One of my favorite aspects of working in a university is the people I meet and interact with on a regular basis. However, academic bullying is a <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C39&q=academic+bullying+higher+education&btnG=&oq=academic+bullying">well-documented phenomenon</a> and the risks are unevenly distributed. Pre-tenure faculty are especially vulnerable, and those who are part of underrepresented populations are doubly so.</p>

<p>If a colleague is malicious toward you, use any appropriate reporting procedures. If there is no appropriate reporting procedure, seek advice from a senior colleague. <em>Do not suffer in silence.</em> Empathy is a good sign; if you don't sense it, seek advice elsewhere. Note that a colleague or administrator who is trying to be an arbiter cannot also be your advocate, and you may need both. Additionally, keep notes on the aberrant behavior, how you responded, and how others responded to your requests for help. Even if there is nothing you can do and no one assists you, your notes could come in handy later for unanticipated reasons.</p>

<p>As part of longer conversations about work, ask pre-tenure faculty who have a few years' experience in your academic unit about who is especially good to work with and who, if anyone, should be avoided. Check with more than one colleague to minimize the role of personal or situational biases.</p>

<p>If you want to initiate a collaboration with someone you've not talked with before, check if anyone you know has already worked with them. Cold contacts are typically fine and sometimes inevitable, but it's reasonable to use your connections to discreetly learn more about potential collaborators.</p>

<h2>You're a Manager Now</h2>

<p>In STEM research, many faculty delegate significant activities to their research assistants. Your success will depend in part on these students' productivity, which depends in part on your ability to give them directions, resources, and a supportive work environment.</p>

<p>Recognize the need for manager skills when working with students. Don't dismiss management and related administrative activities as outside of your obligations. Although they are a step removed from what many people think of as the activity of <em>research</em>, they are essential for research to happen. Instead, devote time to finding ways to manage efficiently, and remember that good management sets the stage for many of the most satisfying interactions you will have with research advisees. Here, efficiency means spending less time on rote activities and more time on the things that you and your advisees most value.</p>


<p>Remember that students working for you may have relatively little experience with workplace norms. Be patient with them, but note whether they improve when you coach them on professionalism. (If they don't, it might be a bad sign for their work.) Also keep in mind that they will model some of their workplace behaviors after yours.</p>

<h2>You Have Freedom to Make Decisions</h2>

<p>The pressure to build your portfolio of activities for tenure and the vague requirements for tenure are two weights on a balance that might seem precarious, with you in the middle. Tenure-stream faculty have abundant freedom and limited supervision. The responsibility to do the right thing for your career in absence of a clearly defined path can seem daunting and oppressive. People sometimes refer to activities that aren't optimized for tenure as "distractions" from it, implying that pretenure faculty possess only a modest ability to judge what is good for themselves.</p>

<p>Remember that success on the scale of tenure doesn't come from a perfect record on everything you try; instead, it comes from an assortment of things done well. For your work to be sustainable (i.e., interesting and motivating for you), it's likely that some of your activities will be personally significant to you but not maximally responsive to tenure criteria.<p>

<p>I spent time mentoring undergraduate researchers when I could have performed other tasks with greater payoff, like submitting more grant proposals or working directly on research. However, mentoring undergraduate researchers is something I enjoy, and that enjoyment gives me energy toward other tasks. Similarly, <a href="advice_for_students.html">Advice for Students</a> was substantial work while being only a minor item for my tenure portfolio. (During my fourth year at Penn State I discovered it had exceeded the word count of my dissertation.) However, it helped my work in many ways, and I've received more gratitude for it than everything else I've written combined.</p>

<h2>Find Your Teaching Strengths</h2>

<p>If your prior teaching experience is limited, teaching will be difficult at first. If you have no prior materials for a course, preparing it <em>de novo</em> will compound the difficulty. Still, you may wonder whether teaching is easier for everyone else and whether you are doing something wrong.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that there exists variation among instructors' strengths: some approaches to teaching that come naturally to other faculty will be time-consuming for you, and some approaches that seem effortless for you will be difficult for others. It's OK if you're not equally good at all things teaching. The things you're good at may be difficult to notice, because you just do them. Once you realize what they are, though, you can use them for all they're worth.</p>

<p>Teaching math and proofs requires a lot of slow, arduous preparation for me. However, guiding a conversation on assigned reading is easy for me; typically I can get an interesting conversation going regardless of class size. My impression is from students' and peers' reviews is that I'm unusually good at that, so I make conversations, audience participation, and small group discussions frequent in my teaching.</p>


<h2>Bearing Witness</h2>

<p>Being faculty means agreeing to bear witness to students' lives. Within classes, meetings, and casual conversations, you will learn about their personal joys and struggles, or observe indirect signs of them. At times you will be more than an observer: your role may provoke their gratitude, anger, reverence, sadness, wonder, or growth. Interacting with students will provoke many of those same things in you.</p>

<p>You will witness students' successes, failures, and many in-between states, and the knowledge that you are watching will itself have an impact on students. With careful mentorship, you can try to make that impact positive regardless of whether they meet their goals. It's not always possible to provide a second try at something, but if a student senses your support, they are more likely to use future opportunities well.</p>

<p>Remember that the vast majority of students will take one trip through college, which limits their perspective on it, while you will witness the process repeat many times. Similarly, nearly every student who completes a PhD will defend a thesis only once in their life, but graduate faculty participate in dozens of defenses over their career. It's a remarkable asymmetry.</p>

<h2>Professor in Progress</h2>

<p>It can be intimidating to realize that your impact on students begins immediately when you start advising and teaching. There are no simulated advisees or simulated courses that you can train on before doing the real thing. Instead, your earliest students will get a different experience than those just a few years later, as your skills improve.</p>

<p>You should work with students in a way you can be proud of, but forgive yourself when you make mistakes. You owe it to the next advisee and the next course to approach them without baggage.</p>

<p>Students may think of professors as unchanging over time, and prior to joining the faculty, you may have unknowingly thought of them that way too. It's easy for students to underestimate their reciprocal impact. This applies both on an individual basis (e.g., the mentees that you remember most vividly) and in aggregate (e.g., the dozens or hundreds of students you may speak with in an average semester). Recognize that the education you provide will always be a work in progress.</p>

<p>Interacting with students is one of my favorite parts of being a professor, which I would have been surprised to learn as an introverted, self-conscious graduate student. I sometimes think about whether my difficult path to becoming faculty made a lasting impact on my personality, or whether finally arriving at a comfortable stage in my career unlocked abilities I didn't realize I had.</p>

<h2>Privilege and Joy</h2>

<p>Many have written about the perils and pressures of seeking an academic career. Graduate school is a crucible for many students, forcing them to make tough decisions about finances, geography, and personal relationships. Postdocs face enormous uncertainty in where they will live next and what their lives will be like. Tenure-stream faculty positions are some of the most difficult jobs to get in their respective STEM disciplines. Positions at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_American_Universities">AAU institutions</a> inspire levels of thirst and envy akin to show business or major-league sports.</p>

<p>If you're in the target audience for this guide then you've already been through the gauntlet, and you may feel embarrassed or guilty about your good fortune. You were lucky when others around you weren't. Messages about academia in the news and in social media might make it seem inappropriate to admit that you enjoy your work.</p>

<p>However, the best response to the privileges of a tenure-stream job isn't denial or admission of guilt; instead, it's to use the privilege to help others who don't have it. How can you help undergraduates discover the personal rewards of research? Can you make graduate school a more equitable and humane experience for your advisees? Are there ways to help contingent instructors and researchers feel at home in your academic unit?  In general, are there things that you wanted on your career journey that you can help junior people find in theirs?</p>

<p>If you're working to improve academia, then to the extent that it feels natural, share your love of being faculty too. You have the capacity to inspire students and colleagues with your joy.</p>
