    <p><em>This page is intended for faculty, but thematically it fits into the part of my website I (anachronistically) call <a href="advice_for_students.html">Advice for Students</a>.</em></p>

    <h1>Read This First</h1>

    <p>Lorem Ipsum.</p>

<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<h2>Recognize the Clean Start</h2>

<p>Context: Prior to starting a tenure-stream faculty position, you may have had difficult experiences with earning a PhD, being a postdoc, or interviewing for faculty positions. You may feel impostor syndrome or a need to proactively prove that your past struggles are behind you.</p>

<p>Advice: It's extremely unlikely that your new colleagues know the specific obstacles you faced. That's because they have no reason to know, and because new pre-tenure faculty are mostly treated the same regardless of their background. The expectations are roughly equal for those joining straight from their PhD, joining after a postdoc position (or several postdoc positions), or joining after an interlude in industry. A new faculty member who spent several years on the academic job market and submitted hundreds of applications receives the same onboarding and expectations as someone who spent just one year on the market or submitted few (even just one) applications.</p>

<p>Personal Example: When I started my first faculty position (at University of Cincinnati), none of my colleagues knew that I needed two application cycles to get into any PhD programs, that I had finished my PhD without any job offers and was unemployed for three months before becoming a postdoc, or that I had spent four years on the academic job market. When I started my second faculty position (at Penn State), none of my colleagues knew that I had spent six years on the academic job market. Initially at each new university I didn't talk about those things with colleagues, as I didn't want them to define me. However I gradually shared more, especially with students, as I realized the stories I could tell were assets for teaching and mentoring.</p>

<h2>Get the Computing Equipment You Want</h2>

<p>Context: If you have a startup fund that includes computing equipment expenses, you might be uncertain what to do with the money or you might be hesitant to spend it.</p>

<p>Advice: Get the computing equipment you want. If it's (1) within budget, (2) something that will help your productivity, and (3) not wasteful, go ahead and order it. Your university expects a lot from you, and those funds are intended to help you succeed.</p>

<p>Remember human factors. In particular, get the keyboard and mouse or trackpad that you've always wanted. You'll use them a lot.</p>

<p>If you observe senior faculty members using old or outdated computing equipment, don't be afraid to get nicer things. Lack of interest or lack of time might be preventing them from upgrading.</p>

<p>Check if you can order equipment early enough prior to your start date that it will be waiting for you when you arrive.</p>

<p>Personal Example: I used my startup to purchase a desktop computer, a second display for the desktop, a laptop, a wall-mounted display, and a GPU server. My research advisees use the wall-mounted display (a TV that masquerades as framed art when not in use) to present during meetings. I also connect the display to a computer and a webcam so that students can gather with me to videoconference with remote collaborators.</p>

<h2>Declaring a Lab</h2>

<p>Context: You might be sheepish about referring to your advisees (potentially none) plus yourself as a lab until you have more advisees, on the basis that it seems presumptuous or flamboyant.</p>

<p>Advice: Even without advisees, go ahead and name your lab and start referring to it. Think of it as a naming a small business you just started: the organization exists even when it's just you. Check that no one else at the university already claimed the name you want, and avoid "center" or "institute" in the name, as universities tend to regulate those terms.</p>

<p>Remember that your lab name can serve as a side channel for communicating your expertise. In other words, it's a way to tell people (e.g., students, colleagues, collaborators) what kinds of research you're interested in.</p>

<p>Personal Example: I had just one research advisee when I began referring to my group as the "Human Language Technologies Lab". I remember it seeming odd and surreal that the lab existed solely because I referred to it, but that's typically how labs exist.</p>

<h2>Check In With People You Know in Academia</h2>

<p>Context: It's been awhile since you last talked with some of your friends and acquaintances who are (or soon will be) in academic positions. It's possible they don't know you're now a tenure-track professor.</p>

<p>Advice: Contact them and let them know you're faculty now. There's a chance they need a collaborator for a project or they will in the future. Don't rely on them seeing the news on social media unless they reacted to it, and even then, getting in contact is a good way to spark conversations about mutual interests.</p>

<p>Personal Example: I've had successful grant proposals with a college roommate and a postdoc labmate. I've also submitted a grant proposal with a graduate school labmate.</p>

<h2>Make Friends</h2>

<p>Context: You've just become faculty and you don't have many local friends who are also faculty.</p>

<p>Advice: This might seem plainly true, but making friends is a good idea. Faculty friends are helpful for being people you can relate to, confide in, and compare experiences with. It's best if you have an assortment in a variety of places: within your department and your research community, within your department but outside your research community (if that's possible), within your college but not your department, within your university but not in your college, and at other universities.</p>

<p>University-wide new faculty orientation is a rare opportunity to meet faculty from different parts of the university who are experiencing the same surge of newness that you are. As always, recognizing boundaries is appropriate (i.e., not everyone is looking to make friends), but your chances of finding people to connect with personally are above average at events like that.</p>

<p>Some academic environments constantly bombard new faculty with pressure to collaborate, and collaboration should be part of your work, but having relatable friends is part of your well-being. It's normal and beneficial to have social interactions that aren't aimed at advancing your career.</p>

<p>None of the above is intended to detract from the importance of also having friends outside academia.</p>

<p>Personal Example: Among my friends who are also faculty is someone I met during a research abroad program as a graduate student, someone I met at the end of the university-wide new faculty orientation, and someone I met while standing in an impossibly long line for food at a conference banquet. Some luck is always involved.</p>

<h1>Getting Organized</h1>

<h2>Keep Track of Your Professional Activities</h2>

<p>Context: Annual reviews, pre-tenure reviews, and the tenure application will expect you to list everything you've done. Even within a single year, remembering all your professional activities will be difficult. However, the record keeping systems for these reports tend to be cumbersome and don't encourage quick edits.</p>

<p>Advice: Have an easy way to keep track of all your professional activities.  A CV is only a start: some items that are appropriate to include in reporting might not be CV-suitable.</p>

<p>Personal Example: I maintain an /update cache/. It's a text document that contains separate to-do lists for additions or changes I need to make to each of my professional materials (CV, personal website, lab website, and faculty activity tracking website). The tasks are brief and informal, like "Add ArXiv paper about privacy law corpus", "add grad admissions committee", or "move [advisee's name] to alumni". Some duplication of tasks between the lists is inevitable and fine.</p>

<p>Instead of updating my professional materials every time I have something to add or change, I accumulate these tasks in the update cache. Periodically I /commit/ the cache (intentional computer science allusion) by processing all the tasks at once. The cache makes recording accomplishments quick and easy. Editing the update cache ten times and then editing my CV once takes far less time and effort than editing my CV ten separate times.</p>

<h2>Keep Track of Your Lab</h2>

<p>Context: Similarly, it can be difficult to keep track of many ongoing aspects of running a lab, such as manuscript statuses and funding requests. Repeatedly searching for information when you forget it is inefficient.</p>

<p>Advice: Keep spreadsheets for things that you want to remember quickly, and update them often.</p>

<p>Personal Example: The following spreadsheets are important for how I run my lab:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Funding Applications: This contains one row for each grant proposal (internal or external), fellowship application, or any other formal request for resources. The columns include: Outcome, Date Submitted, Deadline, Type, Solicitation Name, Solicitation URL, Proposal Name, Collaborators, Outcome Date, and Notes.</li>
    <li>Manuscript Submissions: This contains one row for each manuscript I'm an author on. The columns include: Result, Submitted Date, Deadline, Author Response Period, Author Notification Date, Lab Members Involved, Venue, CFP URL, Location, Event Dates, and Topic or Title, and Notes.</li>
    <li>Lab Members: This contains one row for each of my research advisees. The columns include: Name, Email, Recentest Role, Flags (a list of letters I use to indicate access to lab resources), Onboarding Date, Separation Date, Funding, Co-Advisor, Outcome, Project, and Notes. This spreadsheet helps me stay organized for onboarding and separation of each lab member.</li>
    <li>Lab Meeting Schedule: This is the only lab spreadsheet I share with my research advisees. Each row represents a lab meeting. The columns include: Time, Date, Location, Presenter(s), and Topic(s). At a typical lab meeting one of my advisees presents their research, and this spreadsheet helps me efficiently announce and update the schedule.</li>
    <li>Lab Computers: Each row represents a computer owned by my lab. The columns include: Year Purchased, Current User, Description, and Notes. It can be easy to lose track of all the computers your lab owns, especially those that you don't personally interact with often.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recognize Your Day-to-Day Work</h2>

<p>Context: Being busy for extended periods of time might not give you the sensation that you've made progress toward goals or accomplished a significant number of things.</p>

<p>Advice: Write a log of your work activities and update it often. It doesn't have to be detailed or finely categorized, as long as it validates the time you've spent.</p>

<p>Personal Example: I keep a "work journal" that resembles a series of daily to-do lists except in the past tense. Whenever I write an email, teach a class, attend a meeting, edit a manuscript, or perform another similarly granular activity, I write a brief entry about it. I also specially mark tasks if I perform them after hours or on weekends.</p>

<h2>Make Teaching Notes for Your Future Self</h2>

<p>Context: You get ideas, both big and small, on how to improve a course while you teach it. However, by the time you teach it again you're likely to forget much of what you wanted to change.</p>

<p>Advice: Write to-do course improvements notes in places that you will easily find the next time you teach the course.</p>

<p>Personal Example: Often just after I teach a class session with slides, I create a "post mortem" hidden slide at the beginning of the deck. I typically do it immediately after I dismiss the class, while I'm still standing at the podium. I write what went well (this is reassuring) and what I should change next time I prepare for the lecture. I also keep a "next time" to-do list for the overall course.</p>
