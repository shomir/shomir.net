  <p><em>Students aren't the target audience for this page, but the best place for it on my website is <a href="advice_for_students.html">Advice for Students</a>.</em></p>

<h1>Read This First</h1>

<p>I wrote this page to share timelines and observations from three of my proposals to the US National Science Foundation (NSF) for research funding. One was funded on its second submission (i.e., after a resubmission), one was never funded after six submissions, and one was funded on the first submission. My roles in these proposals included being a <a href="professorspeak.html#pi">PI</a> ("principal investigator", the person who NSF recognizes as leading a proposal), being a co-PI (someone who NSF recognizes having a secondary leadership role, like a co-pilot), and having no official role but being the intellectual lead. This page may be useful for faculty who are just getting started with submitting NSF proposals, or other people who are curious about their genesis and development. The process of applying for funding is often hidden from students and the public&mdash;hence <em>inglorious</em> in the title&mdash;and the obscurity can make it difficult for new faculty and outsiders to understand how the process works and what is normal.</p>

<p>I describe chronology and strategy while leaving out specific research topics or proposal requirements. I submitted these proposals from an <a href="professorspeak.html#r1">R1</a> university in a college with a strong research mission, and all three proposals I describe are to <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/dir/index.jsp?org=CISE">CISE</a>, NSF's directorate for computing and information science research. Note that norms and procedures may vary by discipline, funding source (e.g., NSF, DARPA, etc.), funding goal (research, education, infrastructure, etc.), and other factors.</p>
  
  <p>New faculty also may wish to read my <a href="professorspeak.html">Guide to Professorspeak</a>.

  <p>This page contains unofficial information, and any errors are mine.</p>

<h1>Privilege and Funding</h1>

<p>Getting NSF grants is difficult, and several factors contributed to my successes. I was a postdoc for five years before becoming tenure-line faculty, which gave me time beyond the PhD to learn more about research funding prior to seeking it directly. I submitted these proposals from universities with robust research facilities. Additionally, although all three proposals' timelines cross the COVID-19 pandemic, I was fortunate to be able to work during it with fewer obstacles than many of my peers.</p>

<p>It is possible that I would say different things about the funding process if none of these proposals had been successful. However, note that in aggregate, I am describing seven rejections and two approvals. Even with some luck, the process is difficult and time-consuming.</p>

  <h1>Proposals Timelines</h1>
  
  <a name="slow"></a>
  <h2>Proposal 1: Slow and Steady</h2>
  
  <p><strong>Briefly: Five and a half years elapsed between having the idea for the proposal and receiving funding. The proposal was funded on the second try.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Fall 2017:</strong> I read a report from a think tank that gave me an idea for a research direction. I didn't have the time or resources to pursue it, so I wrote it down in a list of research ideas I keep for future use.</p>

<p><strong>Fall 2018:</strong> After moving to PSU, I revisited the idea and started talking with a colleague about it. She was interested too and had some thoughts about it, and soon the idea evolved to become jointly ours. We began looking for a graduate student to work on a small preliminary version of the idea ("mini-idea" below) and some seed funding to support the student.</p>

<p><strong>Spring 2019:</strong> We submitted a "pre-proposal prospectus" to a special limited-time NSF funding opportunity. NSF rejected it.</p>

<p><strong>Fall 2019:</strong> We recruited an MS student to work on the mini-idea with us and we applied for a seed grant from the university ($25K from PSU's Center for Social Data Analytics), which we received.</p>

<p><strong>Spring 2020:</strong> The MS student told us she was enjoying research so much that she planned to switch to the PhD program. This wasn't directly related to getting the grant, but it was nice.</p>

<p><strong>Fall 2020:</strong> We submitted a paper to a conference with the results of the mini-idea. (Researchers in many fields focus their publishing in journals, but in computing we tend to focus on publishing in conferences instead.)</p>

<p><strong>Spring 2021:</strong> The conference accepted the paper for publication. This gave us an important supporting piece for a grant proposal, by demonstrating the merit of the full-sized idea.</p>

<p><strong>Fall 2021:</strong> We decided we had enough material to write a full proposal to NSF. It would be for more money than our prior NSF attempt and for much more than the seed grant from the university. We also decided to switch roles on this proposal:</strong> my colleague would lead by being the PI ("principal investigator") and I would be a co-PI. Also, we brought onboard a second co-PI who had relevant knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>Spring 2022:</strong> We submitted the proposal.</p>

<p><strong>Summer 2022:</strong> NSF rejected the proposal, but the reviews were generally supportive. We decided to try again. For unrelated reasons, the second co-PI had to drop out of the proposal.</p>

<p><strong>Fall 2022:</strong> We made changes to the proposal and submitted it a second time.</p>

<p><strong>Spring 2023:</strong> NSF gave us the grant.</p>
  
  <a name="six"></a>
  <h2>Proposal 2: Six Tries and Never Funded</h2>
  
  <p><strong>Briefly: I lead six submissions of a grant proposal: two as a postdoc, two in my first faculty position, and two in my second faculty position. The proposal never received funding.</strong></p>
  
  <p><strong>Fall 2014:</strong> As a postdoc at CMU, I told my supervisor that I was interested in leading an NSF grant proposal, and I suggested an idea based upon my research over the past year. He suggested we apply for a "Small", worth up to $500K. My supervisor would need to be the PI because I wasn't eligible, and I would ghost-write most of the proposal. We recruited a second faculty member to be a co-PI. She added some domain-specific applications to the idea, which prior to her involvement had been fairly abstract.</p>

<p><strong>Spring 2015:</strong> Early in the semester we submitted the proposal. We had gone from a basic idea to a submission in under two months, including Winter Break.</p>

<p><strong>Summer 2015:</strong> NSF rejected our proposal. The scores were middling and the reviews showed some clear areas for improvement.</p>

<p><strong>Fall 2015:</strong> We revised the proposal and submitted it a second time.</p>

<p><strong>Spring 2016:</strong> NSF rejected our proposal a second time. The scores had improved slightly.</p>

<p><strong>Fall 2016:</strong> I moved to UC to start as faculty. The two faculty members I had previously worked with on the proposal turned it over to me, and I continued working on it alone, removing the parts that they wrote and replacing them with my ideas. The former co-PI agreed to give input to the project if the proposal was accepted, and she provided a letter to formalize that in the proposal. I revised the proposal and submitted it a third time.</p>

<p><strong>Spring 2017:</strong> NSF rejected the proposal. The reviewers' scores went down slightly.</p>

<p><strong>Summer 2017:</strong> My college funded me on a trip to Washington, DC to meet with program officers at NSF and NIH. I talked with the program officer who had been receiving my proposal, and she provided some feedback.</p>

<p><strong>Fall 2017:</strong> I revised the proposal, including changes to follow the program officer's advice. I submitted the proposal a fourth time.</p>

<p><strong>Spring 2018:</strong> Early in the year, an NSF program officer told me that the proposal was unlikely to be funded and recommended that I withdraw it, which I did. Separately, I recruited an MS student in his final year to work on a miniature proof-of-concept version of the idea in the proposal.</p>

<p><strong>Summer 2018:</strong> The MS student graduated, having written his thesis on the proof-of-concept work. He also submitted a paper about it to a conference, and it was accepted for publication.</p>

<p><strong>Fall 2018:</strong> I moved from UC to PSU. I submitted a miniature version of the proposal to a private funding call, and it was rejected. Later in the semester, I found another faculty member whose interests aligned with the proposal ideas, and I asked him to join as a co-PI. We revised the proposal, including the MS student's preliminary work, and submitted it a fifth time.</p>

<p><strong>Spring 2019:</strong> NSF rejected the proposal. The scores were an improvement over the previous time.</p>

<p><strong>Fall 2019:</strong> We recruited a PhD student for more proof-of-concept work. We made the most substantial changes to the proposal since the initial draft. We needed to modernize it, as the research landscape around it had changed substantially. We submitted it a sixth time.</p>

<p><strong>Spring 2020:</strong> NSF rejected the proposal. The reviewers' scores were lower than last time, and some were confused by our modernization efforts. I had other ideas I wanted to spend more time on, and I was less enthusiastic about this one than I had been in the past. I decided to set it aside. The PhD student switched to a different project, though two years later we would publish his proof-of-concept work in a conference.</p>
  
  <a name="team"></a>
  <h2>Proposal 3: Team Effort</h2>

  <p><strong>Briefly: I led a team of four PIs across three organizations to submit a $1.2M NSF proposal, which we received on the first try. In contrast, a paper on preliminary work to support the proposal took four tries to get published. Three years elapsed before the first discussion of the proposal idea and receiving the funding.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Spring 2018:</strong> While interviewing for a faculty position at PSU, a faculty member had an idea for a project at the intersection between our research interests. Neither of us could make it happen alone. I wrote it down in my list of research ideas for future use.</p>

<p><strong>Fall 2018:</strong> I moved to PSU and reconnected with the faculty member about the idea. We applied for a seed grant from our college to support a graduate student for a year to work on a small version of the project.</p>

<p><strong>Spring 2019:</strong> We received the seed grant. We hired a student to start on the project in fall semester, when he would join the PhD program.</p>

<p><strong>Fall 2019:</strong> The PhD student started working and soon had preliminary results, including a demo we could share with potential collaborators.</p>

<p><strong>Spring 2020:</strong> We asked for a one-year renewal of the seed grant, and we received it.</p>

<p>We had a conversation with a potential collaborator who could bring in relevant expertise that neither of us had, but it didn't seem like a good fit.</p>

<p>We submitted our first paper about the project to a conference. (We would submit two others during the period covered by this timeline, eventually getting them published, but this was the first and the most central to the project. For clarity, I've omitted the others from the timeline below.) We didn't yet have a publication as a proof-of-concept for our idea, but we had several other related publications to point to as evidence that the idea would work.</p>

<p><strong>Summer 2020:</strong> We began planning to submit an NSF grant proposal in the fall. Initially I leaned toward a "Small" (a grant for up to $500K), but after speaking with several faculty I decided on a "Medium" (up to $1.2M), which would enable us to recruit more collaborators and support more students. I had a conversation with another potential collaborator; we had been postdoc labmates at CMU and now worked as faculty at different universities. He was enthusiastic. We needed a fourth person to fit a key role (the same role I had been trying to fill in the spring), and he had a suggestion for a person at a nonprofit organization. We contacted her and she was willing to join. That completed our "PI team" of four:</strong> I was the lead PI, my collaborator at PSU was a co-PI, and the two additional people were PIs at their respective organizations.</p>

<p>Meanwhile an MS student joined the project, increasing our rate of progress.</p>

<p>The first paper submission was rejected, and we revised it and resubmitted it to a second conference.</p>

<p><strong>Fall 2020:</strong> We wrote the proposal and submitted it. With four PIs spread across three sites, coordinating our work was a task itself. Staff at all the sites also coordinated to support us, and students contributed edits and a small amount of text.</p>

<p>The second paper submission was rejected. We revised it and resubmitted it to a third conference.</p>

<p><strong>Spring 2021:</strong> A program officer at NSF asked us to respond to a potential criticism of the project. We drafted a response and sent it to her. She told us that she would recommend it for funding, and in a few weeks NSF gave us the grant.</p>

<p>The MS student graduated, having written her thesis on her work with our project.</p>

<p>The third paper submission was rejected. We revised it and submitted it to a fourth conference, which would finally accept it in Summer 2021.</p>
