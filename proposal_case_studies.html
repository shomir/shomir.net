  <h1>Case Scenarios</h1>
  
  <a name="slow"></a>
  <h2>Scenario 1: Slow and Steady</h2>
  
  <p><strong>Fall 2017:</strong> I read a report from a think tank that gave me an idea for a research direction. I didn't have the time or resources to pursue it, so I wrote it down in a list of research ideas I keep for future use.</p>

<p><strong>Fall 2018:</strong> After moving to Penn State, I revisited the idea and started talking with a colleague about it. She was interested too and had some thoughts about it, and soon the idea evolved to become jointly ours. We began looking for a graduate student to work on a small preliminary version of the idea ("mini-idea" below) and some seed funding to support the student.</p>

<p><strong>Spring 2019:</strong> We submitted a "pre-proposal prospectus" to a special limited-time NSF funding opportunity. NSF rejected it.</p>

<p><strong>Fall 2019:</strong> We recruited an MS student to work on the mini-idea with us and we applied for a seed grant from the university ($25K from Penn State's Center for Social Data Analytics), which we received.</p>

<p><strong>Spring 2020:</strong> The MS student told us she was enjoying research so much that she planned to switch to the PhD program. This wasn't directly related to getting the grant, but it was nice.</p>

<p><strong>Fall 2020:</strong> We submitted a paper to a conference with the results of the mini-idea. (Researchers in many fields focus their publishing in journals, but in computing we tend to focus on publishing in conferences instead.)</p>

<p><strong>Spring 2021:</strong> The conference accepted the paper for publication. This gave us an important supporting piece for a grant proposal, by demonstrating the merit of the full-sized idea.</p>

<p><strong>Fall 2021:</strong> We decided we had enough material to write a full proposal to NSF. It would be for more money than our prior NSF attempt and for much more than the seed grant from the university. We also decided to switch roles on this proposal:</strong> my colleague would lead by being the PI ("principal investigator") and I would be a co-PI. Also, we brought onboard a second co-PI who had relevant knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>Spring 2022:</strong> We submitted the proposal.</p>

<p><strong>Summer 2022:</strong> NSF rejected the proposal, but the reviews were generally supportive. We decided to try again. For unrelated reasons, the second co-PI had to drop out of the proposal.</p>

<p><strong>Fall 2022:</strong> We made changes to the proposal and submitted it a second time.</p>

<p><strong>Spring 2023:</strong> NSF gave us the grant.</p>
