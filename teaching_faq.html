  <h1>Read This Part First</h1>

  <p>I've written this FAQ for the following audiences, which are not mutually exclusive of each other:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>College students who take my classes and are new to the expectations of college courses</li>
    <li>College students who are uncertain about how to interact with faculty, or are intimidated by them</li>
    <li>International students (undergraduate and graduate) who are new to the cultural norms at American universities</li>
    <li>Anyone (students and others) interested in the obsessive details and distinctions of academia</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>Don't be intimidated by the length of this document:</strong> I've organized the questions into sections to make it easier to navigate. Also, note that I've not written a comprehensive guide to college; these are merely the questions I hear most often or find the most interesting.</p>

  <p><strong>All of the questions in this FAQ are legit:</strong> each one represents something that at least one person has asked me or asked my colleagues. Knowledge about college and academia is not evenly distributed, and this document is my modest contribution toward a remedy.</p>

  <p>Finally, if you find this FAQ useful then please email me (see <a href="https://shomir.net">"Contacting Me" instructions</a>) or let me know on <a href="https://twitter.com/ShomirWilson">Twitter</a>.</p>

  <h1>Communicating with Faculty</h1>

  <h3>How do I address a faculty member, in person or via email?</h3>
  <p>Many students struggle with this. Here's a quick guide. I use "M#." below as a catch-all for "Mr.", "Ms.", "Mx.", and other similar titles, and you should replace the '#' as appropriate in acutal writing.</p>

  <ul>
  <li>If a faculty member has "professor" in their job title, "Professor [family name]" is appropriate when speaking and "Prof. [family name]" is appropriate in an email. Do not address them as "M#. [family name]". If a professor has a doctoral degree (e.g., a PhD), "Dr. [family name]" is an acceptable alternative, though you might still use "Prof. [family name]" for simplicity.</li>
  <li>If a non-professor faculty member (or anyone at a university) has a doctoral degree, then address them as "Dr. [family name]". Do not address them as "M#. [family name]".</li>
  <li>If someone at a university neither has "professor" in their title nor has a doctoral degree, "M#. [family name]" is probably fine. When addressing women, use "Ms.". Avoid using "Mrs." or "Miss" unless you are instructed to do so.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Students sometimes forget to use "Prof." or "Dr." when addressing women who are professors and/or doctoral degree holders. Remember that they deserve equal respect. Also, if you're completely uncertain whether "Prof.", "Dr.", "Mr.", "Ms.", or something else is appropriate, it's fine to ask.</p>
  <p>If you mess up, there's no need to apologize: just remember the right title for next time.</p>
  <p>Finally, some faculty may invite you to disregard these rules. It's best to wait until you are invited, though.</p>
  <p><em>Personal aside: Faculty sometimes follow these rules when addressing each other, and sometimes they don't. Factors include how well they know each other, relative levels of seniority, and personal style. There are some faculty I knew when I was a college student whom I still feel odd addressing on a first-name basis.</em></p>

  <h3>How do I write an email to a professor?</h3>

  <p>First, see the question above on how to address a faculty member. Begin your email with "Hello [addressee]," or "Dear [addressee],". Using myself as an example, since "professor" is in my job title and I have a PhD, all of the following are fine ways to start an email to me: "Dear Prof. Wilson," "Dear Dr. Wilson," "Hello Prof. Wilson," or "Hello Dr. Wilson,". Avoid the informal "Hey [addressee],".</p>
  <p>Write the body of your email in complete sentences, with the capitalization and punctuation you would use for formal writing, like an essay. Avoid abbreviations from messaging platforms (e.g., "LOL") and repeated punctuation ("??").</p>
  <p>Close with "Thanks," or "Sincerely," (or something similar), then skip a line or two and write your name.</p>
  <p>These guidelines are the same professional email guidelines you may need for many years to come. For example, they also apply to emails to job recruiters and co-workers.</p>

  <h3>I can't figure out whether someone is a professor, a staff member, a student, etc. How do I ask politely?</h3>
  <p>Ask "What's your role here?", "What's your role in the department?", "What's your role at the university?", or something similar and suitable for the context.<p>
  <p><em>Personal aside: Even as faculty, I sometimes have to ask questions like those. Students come in all ages, and many faculty do not conform their appearances to faculty stereotypes.</em></p>

  <h3>Why didn't a faculty member say hello to me when we passed in the hallway?</h3>
  <p>They probably didn't recognize you, but don't feel bad about it. It's difficult for a typical faculty member (including me) to recognize all the students in all of their courses, especially when there are many other students around who are not in their courses.</p>
  <p><em>Personal aside:  I say hello to students I recognize, partly because it's polite and partly because it seemed odd to me as a student when faculty members averted their eyes and passed by in silence. Don't let the limitations of my memory stop you from saying hello! I am fine with this form of embarrassment.</em></p>
  <p><em>Separately, when I was a student, a professor once growled at me when I said hello to them in the hallway. I think it was less about their attitude toward me and more about their acutely strange personality.</em></p>

  <h3>Someone told me I should get to know the faculty teaching my courses. How do I do that?</h3>
  <p>Visit them during office hours: if you have nothing else to talk about, mention you've heard that you should get to know the faculty teaching your courses, and explain why you're taking the course or in a program that requires it. That should be worth a few minutes of conversation, which (if you're truly at a loss for words) might be all you need.
  <p>If you have questions in class, raise your hand and ask them. If you're particularly interested in what a faculty member does, look out for announcements that they will give talks or will participate in other public events.</p>

  <h3>What should I do if I need a letter of recommendation from a faculty member?</h3>
  <p><strong>Let the faculty member know early.</strong> A month's notice is generally safe. If you give them less time, they might be unavailable or they may not have enough time to write the best possible letter for you.</p>
  <p>Write the faculty member an email, following the guidelines elsewhere in this FAQ. Explain all of the following items:
  <ul>
  <li>The opportunity that you need the letter for</li>
  <li>Why the opportunity is important to you (this provides context they can include in their letter)</li>
  <li>Why you chose to ask them for a letter</li>
  <li>How to submit the letter if they agree to write it</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Attach a copy of your resume or CV. Also, make sure to ask them whether they are willing; don't assume that they are.</p>
  <p>If you're uncertain how a faculty member will feel about writing you a letter, you can write your request in a way to find out. For example, "How comfortable would you be writing a letter of recommendation for me for this opportunity?" is a reasonable question. Some faculty respond to this question by saying they can write a "strong letter" if they are enthusiastic, or by saying they can write a "good letter" if they are merely supportive. If it's merely a good letter, it's up to you to decide: it might or might not be sufficient for the opportunity. Typically, earning a strong letter (or even a moderately good one) requires going above and beyond the course requirements. If you anticipate asking for a letter, see the other answers in this FAQ about getting to know faculty and standing out in my class.</p>
  <p>If the faculty member must send a letter of recommendation directly via postal mail (a rarity), provide them with a pre-addressed envelope with a stamp on it.</p>

  <h3>I met a professor and I asked them what they teach, but they gave me a complicated answer. What did it mean?</h3>
  <p>Teaching could be a minority of their effort, and it's possible they were listing their other duties. Some professors are exclusively devoted to teaching, but many balance it with research and administrative activities, and some do not teach at all. I include more about this in <a href="#section_people_you_meet">People You Meet at Universities</a>.</p>

  <p><em>Personal aside: My friend Nathan Schneider wrote a <a href="https://medium.com/@nschneid/the-hatful-candy-juggler-or-my-job-as-an-assistant-professor-88b40eda937">good article</a> about the variety of tasks that tenure-track professors do.</em></p>

<a name="section_college_classes"></a>
  <h1>College Classes</h1>

  <h3>I missed a session of class, or I will need to miss a session of class in the future. What should I do?</h3>
  <p>After your absence, check with a classmate about what you missed, including the material covered and any announcements that were made. Professors tend to prefer that you ask your peers instead of asking themselves (professors): if they teach a large course or more than one course, absences are frequent, and it takes time to reply to everyone. Unless attendance is graded or a graded activity happens during class, there's generally no need to explain your absence to the instructor or to give them a heads-up. However, make sure that you observe any deadlines for assignments. Bear in mind that you may need to turn in work early to meet your obligations.</p>

  <h3>What should I do if I need to leave the classroom early (for example, to use the restroom or to catch a flight)?</h3>
  <p>If it's unexpected (e.g., the restroom), just step out quietly. Unless an activity specifically requires you to be in the room, there's no need to ask for permission.</p>
  <p>If you know that you need to leave class early (e.g., the flight), you may tell the instructor just before class starts. This isn't typically required, but it's a way to reduce the awkwardness.</p>

  <h3>What are "office hours"?</h3>
  <p>Office hours are times when students can visit a faculty member's office to talk with them on a walk-in basis. Students can ask for help understanding assignments or course material. Office hours are also a good time to talk with a faculty member about opportunities to participate in research or to learn beyond the scope of a course.</p>
  <p>Faculty members often feel that their office hours are underutilized, i.e., that students do not visit them often enough when they are struggling with a course or interested in more than a course can offer. Students ought not to feel guilty, embarrassed, or anxious about visiting during them.</p>

  <h3>Another course or an extracurricular activity is taking up my time. Can I be excused from an assignment deadline?</h3>
  <p>Generally no: students are expected to fulfill all of their academic obligations, and extracurricular obligations are lower priorities. However, university policies may carve out specific areas of leeway, which you can bring to a faculty member's attention if necessary. Also note that emergencies, religious holidays, illness, and certain inviolable obligations are not extracurricular activities, and professors may exercise flexibility for these things. (The course syllabus often explains this.)</p>

  <h3>Why do faculty ban eating food in their classes?</h3>
  <p>Several reasons: it's noisier than the eater thinks, it's distracting (both to the insructor and to other students), and it's messy. If people are trying to concentrate, it may trigger <a href="https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/what-is-misophonia">misophonia</a>.</p>

  <h3>What can students in your classes do to stand out?</h3>
  <p>Compared to most of the other answers in this FAQ, this one might be unusually specific to me.</p>
  <p>Beyond earning good grades, you can do the following:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Write well:</strong> I value good writing as an effective conduit for ideas, as an expression of critical thinking, and as an aesthetic accomplishment. This does <em>not</em> mean using big words or complicated sentences, though there are appropriate times for those things in small quantities. Consistent copyediting is an important foundation, and within the context of my classes, I appreciate writing that is efficient, elegant, and unobtrusive.
  <li><strong>Give good presentations:</strong> Just as with writing, I appreciate elegance, efficiency, and attention to detail. However, presentations allow you to show more personal style and showmanship, which keep an audience engaged.</li>
  <li><strong>Speak up in class:</strong> Answer my questions, ask questions, and contribute to discussions. I also appreciate when students find ways to encourage their peers to speak up too.</li>
  <li><strong>Consider optional activities I suggest:</strong> If I mention attending a seminar or applying for a scholarship, do it if you're able and let me know.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>However, you should avoid the following:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Flaunting your intelligence (e.g., asking questions in class with the sole purpose of trying to impress me)</li>
  <li>Speaking poorly of other students or faculty members (if you're tempted to do this, find another way to make your point)</li>
  <li>Assuming that your writing and presentation skills are at an apex (there is no apex, and I continue to improve too)</li>
  </ul>

    <h3>Why are teaching evaluations important? Do faculty pay attention to them?</h3>
    <p>Even though course evaluations may seem like an afterthought, faculty members read them, and so do committees that review faculty job performance. Faculty are required to include teaching evaluations in their portfolios for reappointment and tenure.
    <p><em>Personal aside: Some of the most heartwarming feedback I've received about my job has come from teaching evaluations. Some of the most saddening feedback has come from them, too. Review processes for faculty look for positivity overall, but they tend to recognize that no instructor can please everyone.</em></p>
